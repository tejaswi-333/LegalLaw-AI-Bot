T he Court may infer from this \nthat the omission to set out the manner of the cheating is not material. \n(c) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge. There were many \n109 \n \ntransactions between A and B, and A h ad no means of knowing to which of them the charge referred, and offered no \ndefence. The Court may infer from such facts that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating was, in the case, a \nmaterial error. \n(d) A is charged with the murder of Khoda B aksh on the 21st January, 1882. In fact, the murdered person's name was \nHaidar Baksh, and the date of the murder was the 20th January, 1882. A was never charged with any murder but one, and \nhad heard the inquiry before the Magistrate, which referred exclus ively to the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer \nfrom these facts that A was not misled, and that the error in the charge was immaterial. \n(e) A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January, 1882, and Khoda Baksh (who tried to arrest hi m \nfor that murder) on the 21st January, 1882. When charged for the murder of Haidar Baksh, he was tried for the murder of \nKhoda Baksh. The witnesses present in his defence were witnesses in the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer from \nthis that A was misled, and that the error was material. \n216. Court may alter charge .\u2014(1) Any Court may alter or add to any charge at any time before \njudgment is pronounced. \n(2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and explained to the accused. \n(3) If the alte ration or addition to a charge is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is not \nlikely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused in his defence or the prosecutor in the conduct \nof the case, the Court may, in its discretion, after such  alteration or addition has been made, proceed with \nthe trial as if the altered or added charge had been the original charge. \n(4) If the alteration or addition is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is likely, in the \nopinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid, the Court may either direct a \nnew trial or adjourn the trial for such period as may be necessary. \n(5) If the offence stated in the altered or added charge is one for the prosecution of which previous \nsanction is necessary, the case shall not be proceeded with until such sanction is obtained, unless sanction \nhas been already obtained for a prosecution on the same facts as those on which the altered or added \ncharge is founded. \n217. Recall of witnesses when c harge altered.\u2014Whenever a charge is altered or added to by the \nCourt after the commencement of the trial, the prosecutor and the accused shall be allowed\u2014 \n(a) to recall or re-summon, and examine with reference to such alteration or addition, any witness \nwho may have been examined, unless the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, considers that \nthe prosecutor or the accused, as the case may be, desires to recall or re -examine such witness for the \npurpose of vexation or delay or for defeating the ends of justice; \n(b) also to call any further witness whom the Court may think to be material. \nB.\u2014Joinder of charges \n218. Separate charges for distinct offences. \u2014(1) For every distinct offence of which any person is \naccused there shall be a separate charge, and every such charge shall be tried separately: \nProvided that where the accused person, by an application in writing, so desires and the Magistrate is \nof opinion that such person is not likely to be prejudiced thereby, the Magistrate may try together all or  \nany number of the charges framed against such person. \n(2) Nothing in sub -section (1) shall affect the operation of the provisions of sections 219, 220, 221 \nand 223. \n110 \n \nIllustration \nA is accused of a theft on one occasion, and of causing grievous hurt on anot her occasion.

He \nmay be charged with theft, receiving stolen property, criminal breach of trust and cheating, or he may be charged with having  \ncommitted theft, or receiving stolen property, or criminal breach of trust or cheating. \n(b) In the case mentioned, A is only charged with theft.

Things said or done by conspirator in reference  to common design. \u2013\u2013Where there is reasonable \nground to believe that two or more persons have con spired together to commit an offence or an actionab le \nwrong, anything said, done or written by any one of such persons in reference to their common intention, after \nthe time when such intention was first entertained by any one of them, is a relevant fact as against e ach of the \npersons believed to be so conspiring, as well for t he purpose of proving the existence of the conspira cy as for \nthe purpose of showing that any such person was a party to it. \n \n15 \nIllustrations \nReasonable ground exists for believing that A has j oined in a conspiracy to wage war against the 1[Government \nof India].  \nThe facts that B procured arms in Europe for the pu rpose of the conspiracy, C collected money in Calcu tta for a \nlike object, D persuaded persons to join the conspi racy in Bombay, E published writings advocating the  object in \nview at Agra, and F transmitted from Delhi to G at Kabul the money which C had collected at Calcutta, and the \ncontents of a letter written by H giving an account  of the conspiracy, are each relevant, both to prov e the existence \nof the conspiracy, and to prove A\u2019s complicity in i t, although he may have been ignorant of all of the m, and \nalthough the persons by whom they were done were st rangers to him, and although they may have taken pl ace \nbefore he joined the conspiracy or after he left it. \n11. When facts not otherwise relevant become releva nt. \u2013\u2013Facts not otherwise relevant are     \nrelevant\u2013\u2013  \n(1) if they are inconsistent with any fact in issue or relevant fact;  \n(2) if by themselves or in connection with other facts they make the existence or non-existence of \nany fact in issue or relevant fact highly probable or improbable.  \nIllustrations \n (a) The question is, whether A committed a crime at Calcutta on a certain day.  \nThe fact that, on that day, A was at Lahore is relevant.  \nThe fact that, near the time when the crime was com mitted, A was at a distance from the place where it  was \ncommitted, which would render it highly improbable, though not impossible, that he committed it, is relevant. \n(b) The question is, whether A committed a crime.  \nThe circumstances are such that the crime must have  been committed either by A, B, C or D. Every fact which \nshows that the crime could have been committed by n o one else, and that it was not committed by either  B, C or D, \nis relevant.  \n12. In suits for damages, facts tending to enable C ourt to determine amount are relevant . \u2013\u2013 In \nsuits in which damages are claimed, any fact which will enable the Court to determine the amount of \ndamages which ought to be awarded, is relevant. \n13. Facts relevant when right or custom is in quest ion. \u2013\u2013Where the question is as to the existence \nof any right or custom, the following facts are relevant:\u2013\u2013  \n(a) any transaction by which the right or custom in q uestion was created, claimed, modified, \nrecognised, asserted or denied, or which was inconsistent with its existence; \n(b) particular instances in which the right or custom  was claimed, recognised or exercised, or in \nwhich its exercise was disputed, asserted or departed from.  \n                                                      \n1. Subs. by the A.O. 1950, for \u201cQueen\u201d. \n16 \nIllustrations \nThe question is, whether A has a right to a fishery.  \nA deed conferring the fishery on A\u2019s ancestors, a m ortgage of the fishery by A\u2019s father, a subsequent grant of \nthe fishery by A\u2019s father, irreconcilable with the mortgage, particular instances in which A\u2019s father exercised the \nright, or in which the exercise of the right was stopped by A\u2019s neighbours, are relevant facts. \n14. Facts showing existence of state of mind, or of  body of bodily feeling. \u2013\u2013Facts showing the \nexistence of any state of mind such as intention, k nowledge, good faith, negligence, rashness, ill-wil l or \ngood-will towards any particular person, or showing  the existence of any state of body or bodily feeli ng, \nare relevant, when the existence of any such state of mind or body or bodily feeling is in issue or relevant.  \n1[Explanation 1.\u2013\u2013A fact relevant as showing the existence of a r elevant state of mind must show that \nthe state of mind exists, not generally, but in reference to the particular matter in question.  \nExplanation  2.\u2013\u2013But where, upon the trial of a person accused of an offence, the previous \ncommission by the accused of an offence is relevant  within the meaning of this section, the previous \nconviction of such person shall also be a relevant fact. 2] \nIllustrations \n(a) A is accused of receiving stolen goods knowing th em to be stolen. It is proved that he was in posses sion of a \nparticular stolen article.  \nThe fact that, at the same time, he was in possessi on of many other stolen articles is relevant, as te nding to show \nthat he knew each and all of the articles of which he was in possession to be stolen.  \n3[( b) A is accused of fraudulently delivering to anothe r person a counterfeit coin which, at the time when  he \ndelivered it, he knew to be counterfeit. \nThe fact that, at the time of its delivery, A was p ossessed of a number of other pieces of counterfeit  coin is \nrelevant.  \nThe fact that A had been previously convicted of de livering to another person as genuine a counterfeit  coin \nknowing it to be counterfeit is relevant.] \n(c) A sues B for damage done by a dog of B\u2019s, which B  knew to be ferocious. \nThe fact that the dog had previously bitten X, Y and Z, and that they had made complaints to B, are relevant.  \n(d) The question is, whether A, the acceptor of a bil l of exchange, knew that the name of the payee was \nfictitious. \n The fact that A had accepted other bills drawn in the same manner before they could have been transmi tted to \nhim by the payee if the payee had been a real perso n, is relevant, as showing that A knew that the pay ee was a \nfictitious person.  \n(e) A is accused of defaming B by publishing an imputation intended to harm the reputation of B.  \nThe fact of previous publications by A respecting B , showing ill-will on the part of A towards B is re levant, as \nproving A\u2019s intention to harm B\u2019s reputation by the  particular publication in question.  \n                                                      \n1.

Subs. by Act 3 of 1891, s. 1( 2), ibid . for the original Illustration  (b).  \n17 \nThe facts that there was no previous quarrel betwee n A and B, and that A repeated the matter complaine d of as \nhe heard it, are relevant, as showing that A did not intend to harm the reputation of B. \n (f) A is sued by B for fraudulently representing to B  that C was solvent, whereby B, being induced to tr ust C, \nwho was insolvent, suffered loss.  \nThe fact that, at the time when A represented C to be solvent, C was supposed to be solvent by his nei ghbours \nand by persons dealing with him, is relevant, as showing that A made the representation in good faith. \n (g) A is sued by B for the price of work done by B, u pon a house of which A is owner, by the order of C,  a \ncontractor.  \nA\u2019s defence is that B\u2019s contract was with C. \nThe fact that A paid C for the work in question is relevant, as proving that A did, in good faith, mak e over to C \nthe management of the work in question, so that C w as in a position to contract with B on C\u2019s own acco unt, and not \nas agent for A. \n(h) A is accused of the dishonest misappropriation of  property which he had found, and the question is w hether, \nwhen he appropriated it, he believed in good faith that the real owner could not be found.  \nThe fact that public notice of the loss of the prop erty had been given in the place where A was, is re levant, as \nshowing that A did not in good faith believe that the real owner of the property could not be found.  \nThe fact that A knew, or had reason to believe, tha t the notice was given fraudulently by C, who had h eard of \nthe loss of the property and wished to set up a fal se claim to it, is relevant, as showing that the fa ct that A knew of \nthe notice did not disprove A\u2019s good faith.  \n(i) A is charged with shooting at B with intent to ki ll him. In order to show A\u2019s intent the fact of A\u2019s  having \npreviously shot at B may be proved. \n(j) A is charged with sending threatening letters to B. Threatening letters previously sent by A to B ma y be \nproved, as showing the intention of the letters. \n(k) The question is, whether A has been guilty of cruelty towards B, his wife.  \nExpressions of their feeling towards each other shortly before or after the alleged cruelty are relevant facts.  \n(l) The question is whether A\u2019s death was caused by p oison. \nStatements made by A during his illness as to his symptoms are relevant facts.  \n(m) The question is, what was the state of A\u2019s health  at the time when an assurance on his life was effected.  \nStatements made by A as to the state of his health at or near the time in question are relevant facts.  \n(n) A sues B for negligence in providing him with a c arriage for hire not reasonably fit for use, whereb y A was \ninjured. \nThe fact that B\u2019s attention was drawn on other occa sions to the defect of that particular carriage is relevant.  \nThe fact that B was habitually negligent about the carriages which he let to hire is irrelevant. \n(o) A is tried for the murder of B by intentionally shooting him dead. \nThe fact that A on other occasions shot at B is relevant as showing his intention to shoot B.  \n18 \nThe fact that A was in the habit of shooting at people with intent to murder them is irrelevant. \n(p) A is tried for a crime.  \nThe fact that he said something indicating an intention to commit that particular crime is relevant. \nThe fact that he said something indicating a genera l disposition to commit crimes of that class is \nirrelevant. \n15. Facts bearing on question whether act was accid ental or intentional. \u2013\u2013When there is a \nquestion whether an act was accidental or intentional, 1[or done with a particular knowledge or intention,] \nthe fact that such act formed part of a series of s imilar occurrences, in each of which the person doing the \nact was concerned, is relevant. \nIllustrations \n (a) A is accused of burning down his house in order to obtain money for which it is insured. \n The facts that A lived in several houses successively each of which he insured, in each of which a fi re occurred, \nand after each of which fires A received payment fr om a different insurance office, are relevant, as t ending to show \nthat the fires were not accidental.  \n(b) A is employed to receive money from the debtors o f B. It is A\u2019s duty to make entries in a book showi ng the \namounts received by him. He makes an entry showing that on a particular occasion he received less than  he really \ndid receive.  \nThe question is, whether this false entry was accidental or intentional.  \nThe facts that other entries made by A in the same book are false, and that the false entry is in each  case in \nfavour of A, are relevant.  \n(c) A is accused of fraudulently delivering to B a counterfeit rupee.  \nThe question is, whether the delivery of the rupee was accidental.  \nThe facts that, soon before or soon after the deliv ery to B, A delivered counterfeit rupees to C, D an d E are \nrelevant, as showing that the delivery to B was not accidental \n16. Existence of course of business when relevant .\u2013\u2013When there is a question whether a particular \nact was done, the existence of any course of busine ss, according to which it naturally would have been  \ndone, is a relevant fact.  \nIllustrations \n(a) The question is, whether a particular letter was despatched. \nThe facts that it was the ordinary course of busine ss for all letters put in a certain place to be car ried to the post, \nand that particular letter was put in that place are relevant.  \n(b) The question is, whether a particular letter reached A. The facts that it was posted in due course, and was not \nreturned through the Dead Letter Office, are relevant.  \n                                                      \n1. Ins. by Act 3 of 1891, s. 2. \n19 \nADMISSIONS  \n17. Admission defined. \u2013\u2013An admission is a statement, 1[oral or documentary or contained in \nelectronic form], which suggests any inference as t o any fact in issue or relevant fact, and which is made \nby any of the persons, and under the circumstances, hereinafter mentioned. \n18. Admission by party to proceeding or his agent. \u2013\u2013Statements made by a party to the \nproceeding, or by an agent to any such party, whom the Court regards, under the circumstances of the \ncase, as expressly or impliedly authorised by him to make them, are admissions.  \nby suitor in representative character. \u2013\u2013Statements made by parties to suits suing or sued  in a \nrepresentative character, are not admissions, unless they were made while the party making them held that \ncharacter. \nStatements made by \n\u2013\u2013  \n(1) by party interested in subject-matter. \u2013\u2013persons who have any proprietary or pecuniary int erest \nin the subject-matter of the proceeding, and who ma ke the statement in their character of persons so \ninterested, or  \n(2) by person from whom interest derived. \u2013\u2013persons from whom the parties to the suit have \nderived their interest in the subject-matter of the suit, \nare admissions, if they are made during the continu ance of the interest of the persons making the \nstatements. \n19. Admissions by persons whose position must be pr oved as against party to suit. \u2013\u2013Statements \nmade by persons whose position or liability, it is necessary to prove as against any party to the suit , are \nadmissions, if such statements would be relevant as  against such persons in relation to such position or \nliability in a suit brought by or against them, and  if they are made whilst the person making them \noccupies such position or is subject to such liability.  \nIllustration \nA undertakes to collect rents for B.  \nB sues A for not collecting rent due from C to B. \nA denies that rent was due from C to B.  \nA statement by C that he owed B rent is an admissio n, and is a relevant fact as against A, if A denies  that C did \nowe rent to B. \n20. Admissions by persons expressly referred to by party to suit . \u2013\u2013Statements made by persons \nto whom a party to the suit has expressly referred for information in reference to a matter in dispute  are \nadmissions. \nIllustration  \nThe question is, whether a horse sold by A to B is sound.  \nA says to B \u2013\u2013 \u201cGo and ask C, C knows all about it. \u201d C\u2019s statement is an admission. \n21. Proof of admissions against persons making them , and by or on their behalf .\u2013\u2013Admissions \nare relevant and may be proved as against the perso n who makes them, or his representative in interest ; \n                                                      \n1. Subs. by Act 21 of 2000, s. 92 and the Second Schedule, for \u201coral or documentary,\u201d (w.e.f. 17-10-20 00). \n20 \nbut they cannot be proved by or on behalf of the pe rson who makes them or by his representative in \ninterest, except in the following cases:\u2013\u2013  \n (1) An admission may be proved by or on behalf of the  person making it, when it is of such a nature \nthat, if the person making it were dead, it would be relevant as between third persons under section 32. \n (2) An admission may be proved by or on behalf of the  person making it, when it consists of a \nstatement of the existence of any state of mind or body, relevant or in issue, made at or about the ti me \nwhen such state of mind or body existed, and is acc ompanied by conduct rendering its falsehood \nimprobable. \n(3) An admission may be proved by or on behalf of the  person making it, if it is relevant otherwise \nthan as an admission. \nIllustrations  \n (a) The question between A and B is whether a certain  deed is or is not forged. A affirms that it is gen uine, B \nthat it is forged.  \nA may prove a statement by B that the deed is genui ne, and B may prove a statement by A that deed is f orged; \nbut A cannot prove a statement by himself that the deed is genuine, nor can B prove a statement by him self that the \ndeed is forged. \n(b) A, the captain of a ship, is tried for casting her away.  \nEvidence is given to show that the ship was taken out of her proper course.  \nA produces a book kept by him in the ordinary cours e of his business showing observations alleged to h ave \nbeen taken by him from day to day, and indicating t hat the ship was not taken out of her proper course . A may prove \nthese statements, because they would be admissible between third parties, if he were dead, under secti on 32, clause \n(2).  \n(c) A is accused of a crime committed by him at Calcutta. \nHe produces a letter written by himself and dated a t Lahore on that day, and bearing the Lahore post-m ark of \nthat day.  \nThe statement in the date of the letter is admissib le, because, if A were dead, it would be admissible  under \nsection 32, clause ( 2).  \n(d) A is accused of receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen.  \nHe offers to prove that he refused to sell them below their value.  \nA may prove these statements, though they are admis sions, because they are explanatory of conduct infl uenced \nby facts in issue.  \n(e) A is accused of fraudulently having in his possession counterfeit coin which he knew to be counterfeit. \nHe offers to prove that he asked a skilful person t o examine the coin as he doubted whether it was cou nterfeit or \nnot, and that that person did examine it and told him it was genuine. \nA may prove these facts for the reasons stated in the last preceding illustration . \n22. When oral admissions as to contents of document s are relevant. \u2013\u2013Oral admissions as to the \ncontents of a document are not relevant, unless and  until the party proposing to prove them shows that  he \n21 \nis entitled to give secondary evidence of the conte nts of such document under the rules hereinafter \ncontained, or unless the genuineness of a document produced is in question. \n1[22A. When oral admission as to contents of electron ic records are relevant. \u2013\u2013Oral admissions \nas to the contents of electronic records are not re levant, unless the genuineness of the electronic re cord \nproduced is in question.] \n23. Admissions in civil cases when relevant. \u2013\u2013In civil cases no admission is relevant, if it is  made \neither upon an express condition that evidence of it is not to be given, or under circumstances from which \nthe Court can infer that the parties agreed together that evidence of it should not be given.  \nExplanation .\u2013\u2013Nothing in this section shall be taken to exempt  any barrister, pleader, attorney or \nvakil from giving evidence of any matter of which h e may be compelled to give evidence under       \nsection 126.  \n24. Confession caused by inducement, threat or prom ise, when irrelevant in criminal \nproceeding .\u2013\u2013A confession made by an accused person is irrele vant in a criminal proceeding, if the \nmaking of the confession appears to the Court to ha ve been caused by any inducement, threat or 2promise \nhaving reference to the charge against the accused person, proceeding from a person in authority and \nsufficient, in the opinion of the Court, to give th e accused person grounds which would appear to him \nreasonable for supposing that by making it he would  gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal  \nnature in reference to the proceedings against him. \n25. Confession to police-officer not to be proved. \u2013\u2013No confession made to a police-officer 3, shall \nbe proved as against a person accused of any offence. \n26. Confession by accused while in custody of polic e not to be proved against him. \u2013\u2013No \nconfession made by any person whilst he is in the c ustody of a police-officer, unless it be made in th e \nimmediate presence of a Magistrate 4, shall be proved as against such person. \n5[Explanation .\u2013\u2013In this section \u201cMagistrate\u201d does not include th e head of a village discharging \nmagisterial functions in the Presidency of Fort St.  George 6*** or elsewhere, unless such headman is a \nMagistrate exercising the powers of a Magistrate un der the Code of Criminal Procedure,                      \n1882 7 (10 of 1882).] \n27. How much of information received from accused m ay be proved. \u2013\u2013Provided that, when any \nfact is deposed to as discovered inconsequence of i nformation received from a person accused of any \noffence, in the custody of a police-officer, so muc h of such information, whether it amounts to a \nconfession or not, as relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered, may be proved. \n28. Confession made after removal of impression cau sed by inducement, threat or promise, \nrelevant. \u2013\u2013If such a confession as is referred to in section  24 is made after the impression caused by any \nsuch inducement, threat or promise has, in the opinion of the Court, been fully removed, it is relevant. \n29. Confession otherwise relevant not to become irr elevant because of promise of secrecy,        \netc. \u2013\u2013If such a confession is otherwise relevant, it do es not become irrelevant merely because it was \nmade under a promise of secrecy, or in consequence of a deception practiced on the accused person for \nthe purpose of obtaining it, or when he was drunk, or because it was made in answer to questions which  \n                                                      \n1.

Consideration of proved confession affecting person making it and others jointly under trial \nfor same offence. \u2013\u2013When more persons than one are being tried jointl y for the same offence, and a \nconfession made by one of such persons affecting hi mself and some other of such persons is proved, the  \nCourt may take into consideration such confession a s against such other person as well as against the \nperson who makes such confession. \n 1[Explanation .\u2013\u2013\u201cOffence,\u201d as used in this section, includes the  abetment of, or attempt to commit, \nthe offence.]2 \nIllustrations  \n(a) A and B are jointly tried for the murder of C. It is proved that A said\u2013\u2013\u201cB and I murdered C\u201d. The \nCourt may consider the effect of this confession as against B.  \n(b) A is on his trial for the murder of C. There is e vidence to show that C was murdered by A and B, \nand that B said \u2013\u2013\u201cA and I murdered C\u201d.  \nThis statement may not be taken into consideration by the Court against A, as B is not being jointly \ntried. \n31. Admissions not conclusive proof, but may estop. \u2013\u2013Admissions are not conclusive proof of the \nmatters admitted but they may operate as estoppels under the provisions hereinafter contained. \nSTATEMENTS BY  PERSONS  WHO CANNOT BE  CALLED AS WITNESSES  \n32. Cases in which statement of relevant fact by pe rson who is dead or cannot be found, etc., is \nrelevant. \u2013\u2013 Statements, written or verbal, of relevant facts  made by a person who is dead, or who cannot be \nfound, or who has become incapable of giving eviden ce, or whose attendance cannot be procured without an \namount of delay or expense which under the circumst ances of the case appears to the Court unreasonable , are \nthemselves relevant facts in the following cases: \u2013 \u2013  \n(1) When it relates to cause of death. \u2013\u2013When the statement is made by a person as to the cause of \nhis death, or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death, in cases in which \nthe cause of that person\u2019s death comes into question.  \nSuch statements are relevant whether the person who  made them was or was not, at the time when \nthey were made, under expectation of death, and wha tever may be the nature of the proceeding in which \nthe cause of his death comes into question. \n(2) or is made in course of business.\u2013\u2013When the statement was made by such person in the  ordinary \ncourse of business, and in particular when it consi sts of any entry or memorandum made by him in books  \nkept in the ordinary course of business, or in the discharge of professional duty; or of an acknowledgement \nwritten or signed by him of the receipt of money, g oods, securities or property of any kind; or of a \ndocument used in commerce written or signed by him;  or of the date of a letter or other document usual ly \ndated, written or signed by him.  \n(3) or against interest of maker.\u2013\u2013When the statement is against the pecuniary or pr oprietary interest \nof the person making it, or when, if true, it would  expose him or would have exposed him to a criminal  \nprosecution or to a suit for damages. \n                                                      \n1.

Accomplice.  \u2013\u2013 An accomplice shall be a competent witness agai nst an accused person; and a \nconviction is not illegal merely because it proceed s upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplic e. \n  \n134. Number of witnesses.  \u2013\u2013 No particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the \nproof of any fact. \nCHAPTER  X. \u2013\u2013 O F THE  EXAMINATION OF  WITNESSES  \n135. Order of production and examination of witness es.  \u2013\u2013 The order in which witnesses are \nproduced and examined shall be regulated by the law  and practice for the time being relating to civil and \ncriminal procedure respectively, and, in the absence of any such law, by the discretion of the Court. \n136. Judge to decide as to admissibility of evidence.  \u2013\u2013When either party proposes to give evidence \nof any fact, the Judge may ask the party proposing to give the evidence in what manner the alleged fact, if \nproved, would be relevant; and the Judge shall admi t the evidence if he thinks that the fact, if prove d, \nwould be relevant, and not otherwise. \nIf the fact proposed to be proved is one of which e vidence is admissible only upon proof of some \nother fact, such last-mentioned fact must be proved  before evidence is given of the fact first-mention ed, \nunless the party undertakes to give proof of such fact, and the Court is satisfied with such undertaking.  \n                                                      \n1. Ins. by Act 18 of 1872, s. 10. \n2. Subs. by Act 21 of 2000, s. 92 and the Second Schedule, for \u201cSection 131\u201d (17-10-2000). \n54 \nIf the relevancy of one alleged fact depends upon a nother alleged fact being first proved, the Judge \nmay, in his discretion, either permit evidence of the first fact to be given before the second fact is  proved, \nor require evidence to be given of the second fact before evidence is given of the first fact.  \nIllustrations \n(a) It is proposed to prove a statement about a relev ant fact by a person alleged to be dead, which \nstatement is relevant under section 32.  \nThe fact that the person is dead must be proved by the person proposing to prove the statement, \nbefore evidence is given of the statement. \n(b) It is proposed to prove, by a copy, the contents of a document said to be lost. \nThe fact that the original is lost must be proved b y the person proposing to produce the copy, before \nthe copy is produced. \n(c) A is accused of receiving stolen property knowing it to have been stolen. \nIt is proposed to prove that he denied the possession of the property.  \nThe relevancy of the denial depends on the identity  of the property. The Court may, in its discretion,  \neither require the property to be identified before  the denial of the possession is proved, or permit the \ndenial of the possession to be proved before the property is identified.  \n(d) It is proposed to prove a fact (A) which is said to have been the cause or effect of fact in issue. \nThere are several intermediate facts (B, C and D) which must be shown to exist before the fact (A) can be \nregarded as the cause or effect of the fact in issu e. The Court may either permit A to be proved befor e B, \nC or D is proved, or may require proof of B, C and D before permitting proof of A. \n137. Examination-in-chief . \u2013\u2013 The examination of witness by the party who ca lls him shall be called \nhis examination-in-chief.  \nCross-examination. \u2013\u2013 The examination of a witness by the adverse part y shall be called his      \ncross-examination.  \nRe-examination.  \u2013\u2013The examination of a witness, subsequent to the cross-examination by the party \nwho called him, shall be called his re-examination. \n138. Order of examinations.  \u2013\u2013 Witnesses shall be first examined-in-chief, the n (if the adverse party \nso desires) cross-examined, then (if the party calling him so desires) re-examined.  \nThe examination and cross-examination must relate t o relevant facts, but the cross-examination need \nnot be confined to the facts to which the witness testified on his examination-in-chief.  \nDirection of re-examination. \u2013\u2013 The re-examination shall be directed to the expl anation of matters \nreferred to in cross-examination; and, if new matte r is, by permission of the Court, introduced in             \nre-examination, the adverse party may further cross-examine upon that matter. \n139. Cross-examination of person called to produce a document.  \u2013\u2013 A person summoned to \nproduce a document does not become a witness by the  mere fact that he produces it, and cannot be      \ncross-examined unless and until he is called as a witness. \n140. Witnesses to character.  \u2013\u2013 Witnesses to character may be cross-examined an d re-examined. \n141. Leading questions. \u2013\u2013 Any question suggesting the answer which the per son putting it wishes \nor expects to receive, is called a leading question. \n55 \n142. When they must not be asked.  \u2013\u2013 Leading questions must not, if objected to by t he adverse \nparty, be asked in an examination-in-chief, or in a  re-examination, except with the permission of the \nCourt. \nThe Court shall permit leading questions as to matters which are introductory or undisputed, or which \nhave, in its opinion, been already sufficiently proved. \n143. When they may be asked.  \u2013\u2013 Leading questions may be asked in cross-examina tion. \n144. Evidence as to matters in writing.  \u2013\u2013 Any witness may be asked, whilst under examinat ion, \nwhether any contract, grant or other disposition of  property, as to which he is giving evidence, was n ot \ncontained in a document, and if he says that it was , or if he is about to make any statement as to the  \ncontents of any document, which, in the opinion of the Court, ought to be produced, the adverse party \nmay object to such evidence being given until such document is produced, or until facts have been proved \nwhich entitle the party who called the witness to give secondary evidence of it.  \nExplanation . \u2013\u2013 A witness may give oral evidence of statements  made by other persons about the \ncontents of documents if such statements are in themselves relevant facts.  \nIllustration  \nThe question is, whether A assaulted B.  \nC deposes that he heard A say to D\u2013\u2013  \u201cB wrote a le tter accusing me of theft, and I will be revenged \non him.\u201d This statement is relevant, as showing A\u2019s  motive for the assault, and evidence may be given of \nit, though no other evidence is given about the letter. \n1145. Cross-examination as to previous statements in  writing.  \u2013\u2013 A witness may be cross-\nexamined as to previous statements made by him in w riting or reduced into writing, and relevant to \nmatters in question, without such writing being sho wn to him, or being proved; but, if it is intended to \ncontradict him by the writing, his attention must, before the writing can be proved, be called to those parts \nof it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him. \n146. Questions lawful in cross-examination.  \u2013\u2013 When a witness is cross-examined, he may, in \naddition to the questions hereinbefore referred to, be asked any questions which tend\u2013\u2013 \n(1) to test his veracity, \n(2) to discover who he is and what is his position in life, or \n(3) to shake his credit, by injuring his character, although the answer to such questions might tend \ndirectly or indirectly to criminate him, or might e xpose or tend directly or indirectly to expose him to \na penalty or forfeiture: \n2[Provided that in a prosecution for an offence unde r section 376, 3[section 376A, section 376AB \nsection 376B, section 376C, section 376D, section 3 76DA, section 376DB] or section 376E of the Indian \nPenal Code (45 of 1860) or for attempt to commit an y such offence, where the question of consent is an  \nissue, it shall not be permissible to adduce eviden ce or to put questions in the cross-examination of the \nvictim as to the general immoral character, or prev ious sexual experience, of such victim with any per son \nfor proving such consent or the quality of consent.] \n \n                                                      \n1. As to the Application of s. 145 to police-diaries, see  the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), s. 172. \n2. Subs. by Act 13 of 2013, s. 28, for the proviso (w.e.f. 3-2-2013). \n3. Subs. by Act 22 of 2018, s. 9, for \u201csection 376A , section 376B, section 376C, section 376D\u201d (w.e.f.  21-4-2018).   \n56 \n147. When witness to be compelled to answer. \u2013\u2013If any such question relates to a matter relevant  to \nthe suit or proceeding, the provisions of section 132 shall apply thereto. \n148. Court to decide when question shall be asked a nd when witness compelled to answer . \u2013\u2013 If \nany such question relates to a matter not relevant to the suit or proceeding, except in so far as it affects the \ncredit of the witness by injuring his character, th e Court shall decide whether or not the witness sha ll be \ncompelled to answer it, and may, if it thinks fit, warn the witness that he is not obliged to answer i t. In \nexercising its discretion, the Court shall have regard to the following considerations:\u2013\u2013 \n(1) such questions are proper if they are of such a nature that the truth of the imputation conveyed \nby them would seriously affect the opinion of the C ourt as to the credibility of the witness on the \nmatter to which he testifies; \n(2) such questions are improper if the imputation whi ch they convey relates to matters so remote \nin time, or of such a character, that the truth of the imputation would not affect, or would affect in  a \nslight degree, the opinion of the Court as to the c redibility of the witness on the matter to which he  \ntestifies; \n(3) such questions are improper if there is a great d isproportion between the importance of the \nimputation made against the witness\u2019s character and the importance of his evidence;  \n(4) the Court may, if it sees fit, draw, from the wit ness\u2019s refusal to answer, the inference that the \nanswer if given would be unfavourable. \n149. Question not to be asked without reasonable grounds .\u2013\u2013 No such question as is referred to in \nsection 148 ought to be asked, unless the person as king it has reasonable grounds for thinking that th e \nimputation which it conveys is well-founded.  \nIllustrations \n(a) A barrister is instructed by an attorney or vakil  that an important witness is a dakait. This is a \nreasonable ground for asking the witness whether he is a dakait.  \n(b) A pleader is informed by a person in Court that a n important witness is a dakait. The informant, \non being questioned by the pleader, gives satisfact ory reasons for his statement. This is a reasonable  \nground for asking the witness whether he is a dakait.  \n(c) A witness, of whom nothing whatever is known is a sked at random whether he is a dakait. There \nare here no reasonable ground for the question.  \n(d) A witness, of whom nothing whatever is known, bei ng questioned as to his mode of life and \nmeans of living, gives unsatisfactory answers. This  may be a reasonable ground for asking him if he is  a \ndakait. \n150. Procedure of Court in case of question being a sked without reasonable grounds. \u2013\u2013 If the \nCourt is of opinion that any such question was aske d without reasonable grounds, it may, if it was ask ed \nby any barrister, pleader, vakil or attorney, report the circumstances of the case to the High Court or other \nauthority to which such barrister, pleader, vakil or attorney is subject in the exercise of his profession. \n151. Indecent and scandalous questions. \u2013\u2013 The Court may forbid any questions or inquiries which \nit regards as indecent or scandalous, although such  questions or inquiries may have some bearing on th e \nquestions before the Court, unless they relate to f acts in issue, or to matters necessary to be known in \norder to determine whether or not the facts in issue existed. \n57 \n152. Questions intended to insult or annoy. \u2013\u2013 The Court shall forbid any question which appear s to \nit to be intended to insult or annoy, or which, tho ugh proper in itself, appears to the Court needless ly \noffensive in form. \n153. Exclusion of evidence to contradict answers to  questions testing veracity.  \u2013\u2013When a witness \nhas been asked and has answered any question which is relevant to the inquiry only in so far as it tends to \nshake his credit by injuring his character, no evid ence shall be given to contradict him; but, if he a nswers \nfalsely, he may after wards be charged with giving false evidence.  \nException 1.\u2013\u2013 If a witness is asked whether he has been prev iously convicted of any crime and \ndenies it, evidence may be given of his previous conviction.  \nException 2.\u2013\u2013 If a witness is asked any question tending to impeach his impartiality, and answers it \nby denying the facts suggested, he may be contradicted. \nIllustrations \n(a) A claim against an underwriter is resisted on the ground of fraud.  \nThe claimant is asked whether, in a former transaction, he had not made a fraudulent claim. He denies \nit. \n Evidence is offered to show that he did make such a claim.  \nThe evidence is inadmissible. \n(b) A witness is asked whether he was not dismissed from a situation for dishonesty.  \nHe denies it. \nEvidence is offered to show that he was dismissed for dishonesty.  \nThe evidence is not admissible. \n(c) A affirms that on a certain day he saw B at Lahore. \nA is asked whether he himself was not on that day at Calcutta. He denies it.  \nEvidence is offered to show that A was on that day at Calcutta. \nThe evidence is admissible, not as contradicting A on a fact which affects his credit, but as \ncontradicting the alleged fact that B was seen on the day in question in Lahore. \nIn each of these cases the witness might, if his de nial was false, be charged with giving false \nevidence.  \n(d) A is asked whether his family has not had a bloodfeud with the family of B against whom he gives \nevidence.  \nHe denies it. He may be contradicted on the ground that the question tends to impeach his \nimpartiality. \n154. Question by party to his own witness.  \u2013\u2013 \n1[( 1)] The Court may, in its discretion, permit the \nperson who calls a witness to put any questions to him which might be put in cross-examination by the \nadverse party. \n2[( 2) Nothing in this section shall disentitle the pers on so permitted under sub-section ( 1), to rely on \nany part of the evidence of such witness.]  \n155. Impeaching credit of witness. \u2013\u2013The credit of a witness may be impeached in the f ollowing \nways by the adverse party, or, with the consent of the Court, by the party who calls him:\u2013\u2013 \n                                                      \n1. Section 154 numbered as sub-section ( 1) thereof by Act 2 of 2006, s. 9 (w.e.f. 16-4-2006). \n2. Ins. by s. 9, ibid. (w.e.f. 16-4-2006). \n58 \n (1) By the evidence of persons who testify that they,  from their knowledge of the witness, \nbelieve him to be unworthy of credit;  \n(2) By proof that the witness has been bribed, or has  1[accepted] the offer of a bribe, or has \nreceived any other corrupt inducement to give his evidence;  \n(3) By proof of former statements inconsistent with a ny part of his evidence which is liable to be \ncontradicted;  \n2*   *   *   *   * \nExplanation.  \u2013\u2013 A witness declaring another witness to be unwor thy of credit may not, upon his \nexamination-in-chief, give reasons for his belief, but he may be asked his reasons in cross-examinatio n, \nand the answers which he gives cannot be contradict ed, though, if they are false, he may afterwards be  \ncharged with giving false evidence. \nIllustrations  \n(a) A sues B for the price of goods sold and delivered to B.  \nC says that he delivered the goods to B.  \nEvidence is offered to show that, on a previous occasion, he said that he had not delivered goods to B. \nThe evidence is admissible.  \n(b) A is indicted for the murder of B.  \nC says that B, when dying, declared that A had given B the wound of which he died.  \nEvidence is offered to show that, on a previous occasion, C said that the wound was not given by A or \nin his presence.  \nThe evidence is admissible. \n156. Questions tending to corroborate evidence of r elevant fact, admissible.  \u2013\u2013 When a witness \nwhom it is intended to corroborate gives evidence o f any relevant fact, he may be questioned as to any  \nother circumstances which he observed at or near to  the time or place at which such relevant fact \noccurred, if the Court is of opinion that such circumstances, if proved, would corroborate the testimony of \nthe witness as to the relevant fact which he testifies.  \nIllustration \n A, an accomplice, gives an account of a robbery in  which he took part. He describes various \nincidents unconnected with the robbery which occurr ed on his way to and from the place where it was \ncommitted.  \nIndependent evidence of these facts may be given in  order to corroborate his evidence as to the \nrobbery itself. \n157. Former statements of witness may be proved to corroborate later testimony as to same \nfact.  \u2013\u2013 In order to corroborate the testimony of a witn ess, any former statement made by such witness \nrelating to the same fact, at or about the time whe n the fact took place, or before any authority lega lly \ncompetent to investigate the fact, may be proved. \n                                                     \n \n1. Subs. by Act 18 of 1872, s. 11, for \u201chad\u201d \n2. Clause ( 4) omitted by Act 4 of 2003, s. 3 (w.e.f. 31-12-2002). \n59 \n158. What matters may be proved in connection with proved statement relevant under section \n32 or 33.  \u2013\u2013Whenever any statement, relevant under section 3 2 or 33, is proved, all matters may be \nproved either in order to contradict or to corroborate it, or in order to impeach or confirm the credit of the \nperson by whom it was made, which might have been p roved if that person had been called as a witness \nand had denied upon cross-examination the truth of the matter suggested. \n159. Refreshing memory. \u2013\u2013 A witness may, while under examination, refresh his memory by \nreferring to any writing made by himself at the time of the transaction concerning which he is questioned, \nor so soon afterwards that the Court considers it l ikely that the transaction was at that time fresh i n his \nmemory.  \nThe witness may also refer to any such writing made  by any other person, and read by the witness \nwithin the time aforesaid, if when he read it he knew it to be correct.  \nWhen witness may use copy of document to refresh me mory.  \u2013\u2013 Whenever a witness may refresh \nhis memory by reference to any document, he may, wi th the permission of the Court, refer to a copy of \nsuch document: \nProvided the Court be satisfied that there is suffi cient reason for the non-production of the original . \nAn expert may refresh his memory by reference to professional treatises. \n160. Testimony to facts stated in document mentioned in section 159. \u2013\u2013A witness may also testify \nto facts mentioned in any such document as is menti oned in section 159, although he has no specific \nrecollection of the facts themselves, if he is sure that the facts were correctly recorded in the document.  \nIllustration \nA book-keeper may testify to facts recorded by him in books regularly kept in the course of business, \nif he knows that the books were correctly kept, alt hough he has forgotten the particular transactions \nentered. \n1161. Right of adverse party as to writing used to r efresh memory. \u2013\u2013 Any writing referred to \nunder the provisions of the two last preceding sect ions must be produced and shown to the adverse part y \nif he requires it; such party may, if he pleases, cross-examine the witness thereupon. \n162. Production of documents.  \u2013\u2013 A witness summoned to produce a document shall,  if it is in his \npossession or power, bring it to Court, notwithstan ding any objection which there may be to its \nproduction or to its admissibility. The validity of any such objection shall be decided on by the Court.  \nThe Court, if it sees fit, may inspect the document , unless it refers to matters of State, or take oth er \nevidence to enable it to determine on its admissibility.  \nTranslation of documents.  \u2013\u2013If for such a purpose it is necessary to cause a ny document to be \ntranslated, the Court may, if it thinks fit, direct  the translator to keep the contents secret, unless  the \ndocument is to be given in evidence and, if the int erpreter disobeys such direction, he shall be held to \nhave committed an offence under section 166 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860). \n163. Giving, as evidence, of document called for an d produced on notice.  \u2013\u2013When a party calls \nfor a document which he has given the other party n otice to produce, and such document is produced and  \ninspected by the party calling for its production, he is bound to give it as evidence if the party producing it \nrequires him to do so. \n                                                     \n \n1. As to the application of s. 161 to police diaries, see the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Act 2 of 1974), s. 172. \n60 \n164. Using, as evidence, of document production of which was refused on notice. \u2013\u2013 When a party \nrefuses to produce a document which he has had noti ce to produce, he cannot afterwards use the \ndocument as evidence without the consent of the other party or the order of the Court.  \nIllustration  \nA sues B on an agreement and gives B notice to prod uce it. At the trial, A calls for the document and \nB refuses to produce it. A gives secondary evidence  of its contents. B seeks to produce the document \nitself to contradict the secondary evidence given b y A, or in order to show that the agreement is not \nstamped. He cannot do so. \n165. Judge\u2019s power to put questions or order produc tion.  \u2013\u2013 The Judge may, in order to discover \nor to obtain proper proof of relevant facts, ask an y question he pleases, in any form, at any time, of  any \nwitness, or of the parties about any fact relevant or irrelevant; and may order the production of any \ndocument or thing; and neither the parties nor thei r agents shall be entitled to make any objection to  any \nsuch question or order, nor, without the leave of the Court, to cross-examine any witness upon any answer \ngiven in reply to any such question:  \nProvided that the judgment must be based upon facts  declared by this Act to be relevant, and duly \nproved:  \nProvided also that this section shall not authorize  any Judge to compel any witness to answer any \nquestion, or to produce any document which such wit ness would be entitled to refuse to answer or \nproduce under sections 121 to 131, both inclusive, if the question were asked or the document were called \nfor by the adverse party; nor shall the Judge ask a ny question which it would be improper for any othe r \nperson to ask under section 148 or 149; nor shall h e dispense with primary evidence of any document, \nexcept in the cases hereinbefore excepted. \n166. Power of jury or assessors to put questions.  \u2013\u2013 In cases tried by jury or with assessors, the \njury or assessors may put any questions to the witn esses, through or by leave of the Judge, which the \nJudge himself might put and which he considers proper. \nCHAPTER  XI\u2013\u2013 O F IMPROPER  ADMISSION  AND  REJECTION  OF  EVIDENCE  \n167.  No new trial for improper admission or rejection of evidence.  \u2013\u2013 The improper admission or \nrejection of evidence shall not be ground of itself for a new trial or reversal of any decision in any case, if \nit shall appear to the Court before which such obje ction is raised that, independently of the evidence  \nobjected to and admitted, there was sufficient evid ence to justify the decision, or that, if the rejec ted \nevidence had been received, it ought not to have varied the decision. \nTHE SCHEDULE.  \u2013\u2013 [ Enactments repealed. ] Rep. by the Repealing Act , 1938 (1 of 1938), s.  2 and \nthe Schedule ."

Right  of private  defence against  the act  of a  person  of \nunsound mind,  etc.--When an  act which  would otherwise  be a certain \noffence, is  not that  offence, by  reason of  the youth,  the want of \nmaturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication \nof the person doing that act, or by reason of any misconception on the \npart of  that person,  every person  has the  same  right  of  private \ndefence against  that act  which he  would have  if the  act were that \noffence. \n \n                            Illustrations \n \n     (a) Z,  under the  influence of madness, attempts to kill A; Z is \nguilty of  no offence.  But A  has the  same right  of private defence \nwhich he would have if Z were sane. \n \n     (b) A  enters by  night a  house which  he is legally entitled to \nenter. Z, in good faith, taking A for a house-breaker, attacks A. Here \nZ, by  attacking A under this misconception, commits no offence. But A \nhas the  same right  of private defence against Z, which he would have \nif Z were not acting under that misconception. \n \n \n99. \n \n \nActs against which there is no right of private defence. \n \n \n     99. Acts  against which  there is  no right of private defence.-- \nThere is  no right  of private  defence against  an act which does not \nreasonably cause  the apprehension  of death  or of  grievous hurt, if \ndone, or  attempted to  be done,  by a  public servant  acting in good \nfaith under  colour of his office, though that act may not be strictly \njustifiable by law. \n \n     There is  no right  of private  defence against an act which does \nnot reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if \ndone, or  attempted to  be done,  by the direction of a public servant \nacting in  good faith under colour of his office though that direction \nmay not be strictly justifiable by law. \n \n     There is  no right  of private defence in cases in which there is \ntime to have recourse to protection of the public authorities. \n \n \nExtent to which the right may be exercised. \n \n \n     Extent to which the right may be exercised.--The right of private \ndefence in  no case  extends to the inflicting of more harm than it is \nnecessary to inflict for the purpose of defence. \n \n119 \n \n \n     Explanation 1.-A  person is  not deprived of the right of private \ndefence against  an act  done, or  attempted to  be done,  by a public \nservant, as  such, unless  he knows or has reason to believe, that the \nperson doing the act is such public servant. \n \n     Explanation 2.-A  person is  not deprived of the right of private \ndefence against an act done, or attempted to be done, by the direction \nof a  public servant,  unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that \nthe person  doing the  act is acting by such direction, or unless such \nperson states  the authority  under  which  he  acts,  or  if  he  has \nauthority in writing, unless he produces such authority, if demanded. \n \n \n100. \n \n \nWhen the  right of  private defence  of the  body extends  to  causing \ndeath. \n \n \n     100. When  the right  of private  defence of  the body extends to \ncausing death.--The  right of  private defence  of the  body  extends, \nunder the restrictions mentioned in the last preceding section, to the \nvoluntary causing  of death  or of any other harm to the assailant, if \nthe offence which occasions the exercise of the right be of any of the \ndescriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:- \n \n          First.-Such  an   assault  as   may  reasonably   cause  the \n     apprehension that death will otherwise be the consequence of such \n     assault; \n \n          Secondly.-Such  an  assault  as  may  reasonably  cause  the \n     apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence \n     of such assault; \n \n          Thirdly.-An assault with the intention of committing rape; \n \n          Fourthly.-An  assault   with  the  intention  of  gratifying \n     unnatural lust; \n \n          Fifthly.-An assault  with the  intention  of  kidnapping  or \n     abducting; \n \n          Sixthly.-An  assault   with  the   intention  of  wrongfully \n     confining a  person, under  circumstances  which  may  reasonably \n     cause him to apprehend that he will be unable to have recourse to \n     the public authorities for his release. \n \n \n101. \n \n \nWhen such right extends to causing any harm other than death. \n \n \n     101. When  such right  extends to  causing any  harm  other  than \ndeath.--If the offence be not of any of the descriptions enumerated in \nthe last  preceding section,  the right of private defence of the body \ndoes not  extend to  the voluntary  causing of death to the assailant, \nbut does  extend, under  the restrictions  mentioned in section 99, to \nthe voluntary causing to the assailant of any harm other than death. \n \n \n102. \n \n \nCommencement and  continuance of  the right  of private defence of the \nbody. \n \n \n     102. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence \nof the  body.--The right  of private  defence of the body commences as \nsoon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises from an \nattempt or  threat to  commit the  offence though  the offence may not \nhave been  committed; and it continues as long as such apprehension of \ndanger to the body continues. \n \n \n103. \n \n \nWhen the  right of  private defence  of property  extends to  causing \ndeath. \n \n \n     103. When  the right  of private  defence of  property extends to \ncausing death.--The  right of  private defence  of  property  extends, \nunder the  restrictions mentioned  in section  99,  to  the  voluntary \ncausing of  death or  of any  other harm  to the  wrong-doer,  if  the \noffence, the  committing of  which, or the attempting to commit which, \noccasions the  exercise of  the right,  be an  offence of  any of  the \ndescriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:- \n \n          First.-Robbery; \n \n          Secondly.-House-breaking by night; \n \n          Thirdly.-Mischief by fire committed on any building, tent or \n     vessel, which  building, tent  or  vessel  is  used  as  a  human \n     dwelling, or as a place for the custody of property; \n \n          Fourthly.-Theft, mischief,  or  house-trespass,  under  such \n     circumstances as  may reasonably cause apprehension that death or \n     grievous hurt  will be  the consequence, if such right of private \n     defence is not exercised. \n \n120 \n \n \n104. \n \n \nWhen such right to causing any harm other than death. \n \n \n     104. When  such right  to causing  any harm other than death.--If \nthe offence,  the committing  of which,  or the  attempting to  commit \nwhich occasions  the exercise  of the  right of  private  defence,  be \ntheft, mischief,  or criminal trespass, not of any of the descriptions \nenumerated in  the last  preceding section, that right does not extend \nto the  voluntary causing  of death,  but does  extend, subject to the \nrestrictions mentioned  in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the \nwrong-doer of any harm other than death. \n \n \n105. \n \n \nCommencement and  continuance of  the  right  of  private  defence  of \nproperty. \n \n \n     105. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence \nof property.--The  right of private defence of property commences when \na reasonable apprehension of danger to the property commences. \n \n     The right  of private defence of property against theft continues \ntill the offender has effected his retreat with the property or either \nthe assistance  of the public authorities is obtained, or the property \nhas been recovered. \n \n     The  right   of  private  defence  of  property  against  robbery \ncontinues as  long as  the offender causes or attempts to cause to any \nperson death  or hurt  or wrongful restraint or as long as the fear of \ninstant death  or of  instant hurt  or of  instant personal  restraint \ncontinues. \n \n     The  right  of  private  defence  of  property  against  criminal \ntrespass or  mischief continues  as long  as the offender continues in \nthe commission of criminal trespass or mischief. \n \n     The right  of private  defence of property against house-breaking \nby night  continues as long as the house-trespass which has been begun \nby such house-breaking continues. \n \n \n106. \n \n \nRight of  private defence against deadly assault when there is risk of \nharm to innocent person. \n \n \n     106. Right  of private  defence against deadly assault when there \nis risk  of harm  to innocent person.--If in the exercise of the right \nof private  defence against  an assault  which reasonably  causes  the \napprehension of  death, the  defender be  so situated  that he  cannot \neffectually exercise  that right  without risk  of harm to an innocent \nperson, his  right of  private defence  extends to the running of that \nrisk. \n \n                             Illustration \n \n     A is  attacked by  a mob  who attempt  to murder  him. He  cannot \neffectually exercise  his right  of private  defence without firing on \nthe mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming young children who \nare mingled  with the  mob. A  commits no  offence if  by so firing he \nharms any of the children. \n \n \nCHAPTER V \n \n \nOF ABETMENT \n \n \n                                  CHAPTER V \n \n                                 OF ABETMENT \n \n \n107. \n \n \nAbetment of a thing. \n \n \n     107. Abetment  of a  thing.--A person abets the doing of a thing, \nwho- \n \n          First.-Instigates any person to do that thing; or \n \n          Secondly.-Engages with  one or  more other person or persons \n     in any  conspiracy for  the doing  of that  thing, if  an act  or \n     illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and \n     in order to the doing of that thing; or \n \n          Thirdly.-Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, \n     the doing of that thing. \n \n     Explanation 1.-A  person who,  by wilful misrepresentation, or by \nwilful concealment  of a  material fact which he is bound to disclose, \nvoluntarily causes  or procures,  or attempts  to cause  or procure, a \nthing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing. \n \n                             Illustration \n \n     A, a  public officer,  is authorized by a warrant from a Court of \nJustice to apprehend Z, B, knowing that fact and also that C is not Z, \nwilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes \nA to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the apprehension of C. \n \n121 \n \n \n     Explanation 2.-Whoever,  either prior  to or  at the  time of the \ncommission of  an act,  does  anything  in  order  to  facilitate  the \ncommission  of  that  act,  and  thereby  facilitates  the  commission \nthereof, is said to aid the doing of that act. \n \n \n108. \n \n \nAbettor. \n \n \n     108. Abettor.--A  person abets  an offence,  who abets either the \ncommission of  an offence,  or the commission of an act which would be \nan offence,  if committed  by a person capable by law of committing an \noffence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor. \n \n     Explanation 1.-The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may \namount to  an offence although the abettor may not himself be bound to \ndo that act. \n \n     Explanation 2.-To  constitute the  offence of  abetment it is not \nnecessary that the act abetted should be committed, or that the effect \nrequisite to constitute the offence should be caused. \n \n                            Illustrations \n \n     (a) A  instigates B  to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty \nof abetting B to commit murder. \n \n     (b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation \nstabs D.  D recovers  from the  wound. A is guilty of instigating B to \ncommit murder. \n \n     Explanation 3.-It is not necessary that the person abetted should \nbe capable by law of committing an offence, or that he should have the \nsame guilty  intention or  knowledge as  that of  the abettor,  or any \nguilty intention or knowledge. \n \n                            Illustrations \n \n     (a) A,  with a  guilty intention,  abets a  child or a lunatic to \ncommit an  act which  would be  an offence,  if committed  by a person \ncapable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention \nas A.  Here A,  whether the  act be  committed or  not, is  guilty  of \nabetting an offence. \n \n     (b) A,  with the  intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child \nunder seven  years of  age, to do an act which causes Z's death. B, in \nconsequence of  the abetment,  does the  act in  the absence  of A and \nthereby causes  Z's death.  Here, though  B was  not capable by law of \ncommitting an  offence, A  is liable to be punished in the same manner \nas if  B had  been capable  by law  of committing  an offence, and had \ncommitted murder,  and he  is therefore  subject to  the punishment of \ndeath. \n \n     (c) A  instigates B  to set  fire  to  a  dwelling-house.  B,  in \nconsequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of knowing \nthe nature  of the  act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary \nto law,  sets fire  to the  house in consequence of A's instigation. B \nhas committed  no offence,  but A is guilty of abetting the offence of \nsetting fire  to a  dwelling-house, and  is liable  to the  punishment \nprovided for that offence. \n \n     (d) A,  intending to  cause a theft to be committed, instigates B \nto take  property belonging to Z out of Z's possession. A induces B to \nbelieve that  the property  belongs to  A. B takes the property out of \nZ's possession,  in good  faith, believing  it to  be A's property. B, \nacting under  this  misconception,  does  not  take  dishonestly,  and \ntherefore does  not commit  theft. But  A is guilty of abetting theft, \nand is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. \n \n     Explanation 4.-The  abetment of  an offence being an offence, the \nabetment of such an abetment is also an offence. \n \n                             Illustration \n \n     A instigates  B  to  instigate  C  to  murder  Z.  B  accordingly \ninstigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence of \nB's instigation.  B is  liable to be punished for his offence with the \npunishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence, A \nis also liable to the same punishment. \n \n122 \n \n \n     Explanation 5.-It  is not  necessary to  the  commission  of  the \noffence of  abetment by conspiracy that the abettor should concert the \noffence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages \nin the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. \n \n                             Illustration \n \n     A concerts  with B  a plan  for poisoning  Z. It is agreed that A \nshall administer  the poison. B then explains the plan to C mentioning \nthat  a  third  person  is  to  administer  the  poison,  but  without \nmentioning A's  name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and \ndelivers it  to B  for the  purpose of  its being  used in  the manner \nexplained. A  administers the  poison; Z  dies in  consequence.  Here, \nthough A  and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in \nthe conspiracy  in pursuance  of which  Z has  been  murdered.  C  has \ntherefore committed  the offence defined in this section and is liable \nto the punishment for murder. \n \n \n108A. \n \n \nAbetment in India of offences outside India. \n \n \n     1*[108A. Abetment in India of offences outside  India.--A person \nabets an offence within the meaning of this Code  who,  in 2*[India], \nabets the  commission of any act without  and  beyond 2*[India] which \nwould constitute an offence if committed in 2*[India]. \n \n                             Illustration \n \n     A, in 2*[India], instigates B, a  foreigner  in Goa, to commit a \nmurder in Goa, A is guilty of abetting murder.] \n \n \n109. \n \n \nPunishment of  abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence \nand where no express provision is made for its punishment. \n \n \n     109. Punishment  of abetment  if the  act abetted is committed in \nconsequence  and   where  no   express  provision   is  made  for  its \npunishment.--Whoever abets  any offence  shall, if  the act abetted is \ncommitted in  consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is \nmade by  this Code  for the  punishment of  such abetment, be punished \nwith the punishment provided for the offence. \n \n     Explanation.-An act  or  offence  is  said  to  be  committed  in \nconsequence of  abetment, when  it is  committed in consequence of the \ninstigation, or  in pursuance of the conspiracy, or with the aid which \nconstitutes the abetment. \n \n                            Illustrations \n \n     (a) A  offers a  bribe to  B, a  public servant,  as a reward for \nshowing A  some favour  in the  exercise of  B's official functions. B \naccepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence defined in section 161. \n \n     (b) A  instigates B  to give false evidence. B, in consequence of \nthe instigation,  commits that  offence. A  is guilty of abetting that \noffence, and is liable to the same punishment as B. \n \n     (c) A  and B  conspire to  poison  Z.  A,  in  pursuance  of  the \nconspiracy, procures  the poison and delivers it to B in order that he \nmay administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the conspiracy, administers \nthe poison to Z in A's absence and thereby causes Z's death. Here B is \nguilty of  murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, \nand is liable to the punishment for murder. \n \n \n110. \n \n \nPunishment of  abetment if  person abetted  does  act  with  different \nintention from that of abettor. \n \n \n     110. Punishment  of abetment  if person  abetted  does  act  with \ndifferent  intention   from  that   of  abettor.--Whoever   abets  the \ncommission of  an offence  shall, if  the person  abetted does the act \nwith a  different intention  or knowledge from that of the abettor, be \npunished with the punishment provided for the offence which would have \nbeen committed  if the  act  had  been  done  with  the  intention  or \nknowledge of the abettor and with no other. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n1.

Subs. by Act 3 of 1951, s, 3 and Sch., for \"the States\". \n \n123 \n \n \n111. \n \n \nLiability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done. \n \n \n     111. Liability  of abettor when one act abetted and different act \ndone.--When an Act is abetted and a different act is done, the abettor \nis liable  for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent \nas if he had directly abetted it: \n \n \nProviso. \n \n \n     Proviso.--Provided the act done was a probable consequence of the \nabetment, and was committed under the influence of the instigation, or \nwith the  aid or  in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the \nabetment. \n \n                            Illustrations \n \n     (a) A  instigates a  child to  put poison into the food of Z, and \ngives him  poison for  that purpose.  The child, in consequence of the \ninstigation, by  mistake puts  the poison into the food of Y, which is \nby the  side of  that of  Z. Here  if the  child was  acting under the \ninfluence  of  A's  instigation,  and  the  act  done  was  under  the \ncircumstances a  probable consequence  of the abetment, A is liable in \nthe same  manner and  to the  same extent  as if he had instigated the \nchild to put the poison into the food of Y. \n \n     (b) A  instigates B  to burn  Z's house. B sets fire to the house \nand at the same time commits theft of property there. A, though guilty \nof abetting  the burning  of the  house, is not guilty of abetting the \ntheft;  for  the  theft  was  a  distinct  act,  and  not  a  probable \nconsequence of the burning. \n \n     (c) A  instigates B  and C  to break  into an  inhabited house at \nmidnight for  the purpose  of robbery, and provides them with arms for \nthat purpose.  B and  C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, \none of  the inmates,  murder Z.  Here, if that murder was the probable \nconsequence of  the abetment,  A is  liable to the punishment provided \nfor murder. \n \n \n112. \n \n \nAbettor when  liable to  cumulative punishment for act abetted and for \nact done. \n \n \n     112. Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted \nand for  act done.--If  the act  for which the abettor is liable under \nthe last  preceding section  is  committed  in  addition  to  the  act \nabetted, and  constitute a  distinct offence, the abettor is liable to \npunishment for each of the offences. \n \n                             Illustration \n \n     A instigates  B to  resist by  force a  distress made by a public \nservant. B,  in consequence  resists that  distress. In  offering  the \nresistance,  B   voluntarily  causes  grievous  hurt  to  the  officer \nexecuting the  distress. As  B  has  committed  both  the  offence  of \nresisting  the  distress,  and  the  offence  of  voluntarily  causing \ngrievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and, \nif A  knew that  B was  likely voluntarily  to cause  grievous hurt in \nresisting the distress A will also be liable to punishment for each of \nthe offences. \n \n \n113. \n \n \nLiability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different \nfrom that intended by the abettor. \n \n \n     113. Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted \ndifferent from  that intended  by the abettor.--When an act is abetted \nwith the  intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular \neffect, and  an act  for which the abettor is liable in consequence of \nthe abetment,  causes a  different effect  from that  intended by  the \nabettor, the  abettor is  liable for  the effect  caused, in  the same \nmanner and  to the  same extent  as if he had abetted the act with the \nintention of  causing that  effect, provided  he  knew  that  the  act \nabetted was likely to cause that effect. \n \n                             Illustration \n \n     A instigates  B to cause grievous hurt to Z. B, in consequence of \nthe instigation,  causes grievous  hurt to  Z. Z  dies in consequence. \nHere, if  A knew  that the  grievous hurt  abetted was likely to cause \ndeath, A  is liable  to be  punished with  the punishment provided for \nmurder. \n \n \n114. \n \n \nAbettor present when offence is committed. \n \n \n     114. Abettor  present when  offence is  committed.--Whenever  any \nperson who  if absent would be liable to be punished as an abettor, is \npresent when  the act  or offence  for which he would be punishable in \nconsequence of  the abetment  is committed, he shall be deemed to have \ncommitted such act or offence. \n \n124 \n \n \n115. \n \n \nAbetment  of offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life-if \noffence is not committed. \n \n \n     115. Abetment  of offence  punishable with  death or imprisonment \nfor life--if offence not committed.-Whoever abets the commission of an \noffence punishable  with death or 1*[imprisonment  for  life],  shall, \nif that  offence be  not committed in consequence of the abetment, and \nno express  provision is  made by this Code for the punishment of such \nabetment, be  punished with  imprisonment of  either description for a \nterm which  may extend  to seven  years, and  shall also  be liable to \nfine: \n \n \nif act causing harm be done in consequence. \n \n \n     if act  causing harm  be done in consequence.--and if any act for \nwhich the  abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, and which \ncauses hurt  to any  person, is  done, the  abettor shall be liable to \nimprisonment of  either description  for a  term which  may extend  to \nfourteen years, and shall also be liable to fine. \n \n                             Illustration \n \n     A instigates  B to  murder Z.

Culpable  homicide.--Whoever causes  death by  doing an  act \nwith the  intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing \nsuch bodily  injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge \nthat he  is likely  by such act to cause death, commits the offence of \nculpable homicide. \n \n                            Illustrations \n \n     (a) A  lays sticks  and turf  over a  pit, with  the intention of \nthereby causing  death, or  with the knowledge that death is likely to \nbe thereby  caused. Z,  believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, \nfalls in  and is  killed. A  has  committed  the offence  of  culpable \nhomicide. \n \n     (b) A  knows Z  to be  behind a  bush. B  does not  know  it.  A, \nintending to  cause, or  knowing it  to be  likely to cause Z's death, \ninduces B  to fire  at the  bush.  B fires and kills Z.  Here B may be \nguilty of  no offence;  but A  has committed  the offence  of culpable \nhomicide. \n \n     (c) A,  by shooting  at a  fowl with intent to kill and steal it, \nkills B,  who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there. Here, \nalthough A  was doing  an unlawful  act, he was not guilty of culpable \nhomicide, as  he did  not intend to kill B  or to cause death by doing \nan act that he knew was likely to cause death. \n \n     Explanation 1.-A  person who  causes bodily injury to another who \nis labouring  under a  disorder,  disease  or  bodily  infirmity,  and \nthereby accelerates  the death  of that other, shall be deemed to have \ncaused his death. \n \n     Explanation 2.-Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person \nwho causes  such bodily  injury shall  be deemed  to have  caused  the \ndeath, although  by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment \nthe death might have been prevented. \n \n     Explanation 3.-The  causing of  the  death  of  a  child  in  the \nmother's womb  is not homicide. But it may amount to culpable homicide \nto cause  the death  of a  living child, if any part of that child has \nbeen brought  forth, though  the child  may not  have breathed or been \ncompletely born. \n \n \n300. \n \n \nMurder. \n \n \n     300. Murder.--Except  in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable \nhomicide is  murder, if  the act  by which the death is caused is done \nwith the intention of causing death, or- \n \n167 \n \n     2ndly.-If it  is done  with the  intention of causing such bodily \ninjury as  the offender  knows to  be likely to cause the death of the \nperson to whom the harm is caused. or- \n \n     3rdly.-If it  is done with the intention of causing bodily injury \nto any  person and  the bodily  injury intended  to  be  inflicted  is \nsufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or- \n \n     4thly.-If the  person committing  the act  knows that  it  is  so \nimminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death, or \nsuch bodily  injury as  is likely to cause death, and commits such act \nwithout any  excuse for  incurring the  risk of  causing death or such \ninjury as aforesaid. \n \n                            Illustrations \n \n     (a) A  shoots Z  with the  intention of  killing him.  Z dies  in \nconsequence. A commits murder. \n \n     (b) A,  knowing that  Z is  labouring under such a disease that a \nblow is  likely to  cause his death, strikes him with the intention of \ncausing bodily  injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty \nof murder,  although the  blow might  not have  been sufficient in the \nordinary course  of nature  to cause  the death of a person in a sound \nstate of  health. But  if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any \ndisease, gives  him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of \nnature kill  a person  in a sound state of health, here A, although he \nmay intend  to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did \nnot intend  to cause  death, or  such bodily injury as in the ordinary \ncourse of nature would cause death. \n \n     (c) A  intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient \nto cause  the death  of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies \nin consequence.  Here A  is guilty of murder, although he may not have \nintended to cause Z's death. \n \n     (d) A  without any  excuse fires  a loaded cannon into a crowd of \npersons and  kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may \nnot have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. \n \n     Exception  1.-When  culpable  homicide  is  not  murder.-Culpable \nhomicide is  not murder  if the offender, whilst deprived of the power \nof self-control  by  grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of \nthe person  who gave  the provocation or causes the death of any other \nperson by mistake or accident. \n \n     The above exception is subject to the following provisos:- \n \n     First.-That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked \nby the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person. \n \n     Secondly.-That the  provocation is  not given by anything done in \nobedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of \nthe powers of such public servant. \n \n     Thirdly.-That the  provocation is  not given  by anything done in \nthe lawful exercise of the right of private defence. \n \n     Explanation.-Whether the  provocation was grave and sudden enough \nto prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact. \n \n168 \n \n                            Illustrations \n \n     (a) A,  under the  influence of  passion excited by a provocation \ngiven by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, inasmuch \nas the  provocation was  not given  by the child, and the death of the \nchild was  not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused \nby the provocation. \n \n     (b) Y  gives grave  and sudden  provocation  to  A.  A,  on  this \nprovocation, fires  a pistol  at  Y,  neither  intending  nor  knowing \nhimself to  be likely  to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A \nkills Z.  Here  A  has  not  committed  murder,  but  merely  culpable \nhomicide. \n \n     (c) A  is lawfully  arrested by  Z, a  bailiff. A  is excited  to \nsudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, \ninasmuch as  the provocation  was given  by a  thing done  by a public \nservant in the exercise of his powers. \n \n     (d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he \ndoes not  believe a  word of  A's deposition,  and that A has perjured \nhimself. A  is moved  to sudden  passion by  these words, and kills Z. \nThis is murder. \n \n     (e) A  attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right \nof private  defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is \nmoved to  sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This \nis murder,  inasmuch as  the provocation was giving by a thing done in \nthe exercise of the right of private defence. \n \n    (f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. \nA, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and to  cause \nhim to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B  kills Z \nwith the knife. Here B may have committed only  culpable homicide, but \nA is guilty of murder. \n \n     Exception 2.-Culpable  homicide is  not murder if the offender in \nthe exercise  in good  faith of the right of private defence or person \nor property,  exceeds the  power given  to him  by law  and causes the \ndeath of  the person  against whom  he is  exercising  such  right  of \ndefence without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more \nharm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. \n \n                             Illustration \n \n     Z attempts  to horsewhip  A, not  in such  a manner  as to  cause \ngrievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A \nbelieving in  good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself \nfrom being  horsewhipped, shoots  Z dead.  A has not committed murder, \nbut only culpable homicide. \n \n     Exception 3.-Culpable  homicide is  not murder  if the  offender, \nbeing a  public servant  or aiding  a public  servant acting  for  the \nadvancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, \nand causes  death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to \nbe lawful  and necessary  for the  due discharge  of his  duty as such \npublic servant and without ill-will towards the person  whose death is \ncaused. \n \n     Exception 4.-Culpable  homicide is  not murder if it is committed \nwithout premeditation  in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a \nsudden quarrel and without the offender's having taken undue advantage \nor acted in a cruel or unusual manner. \n \n     Explanation.-It is  immaterial in  such cases  which party offers \nthe provocation or commits the first assault. \n \n     Exception 5.-Culpable  homicide is  not murder  when  the  person \nwhose death  is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers \ndeath or takes the risk of death with his own consent. \n \n169 \n \n                             Illustration \n \n     A, by  instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen \nyears of age, to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z's youth, he was \nincapable of  giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted \nmurder. \n \n \n301. \n \n \nCulpable homicide  by causing  death of person other than person whose \ndeath was intended. \n \n \n     301. Culpable  homicide by  causing death  of person  other  than \nperson whose death was intended.--If a person, by doing anything which \nhe intends  or knows  to be  likely to  cause death, commits  culpable \nhomicide by  causing the  death of  any person, whose death he neither \nintends nor knows himself to be likely to cause, the culpable homicide \ncommitted by the offender is of the description of which it would have \nbeen if  he had caused the death of the person whose death he intended \nor knew himself to he likely to cause. \n \n \n302. \n \n \nPunishment for murder. \n \n \n     302. Punishment  for murder.--Whoever  commits  murder  shall  be \npunished with  death, or  1*[imprisonment for life], and   shall  also \nbe liable to fine. \n \n \n303. \n \n \nPunishment for murder by life-convict. \n \n \n     303. Punishment for murder by life-convict.--Whoever, being under \nsentence of  1*[imprisonment for  life],   commits    murder, shall be \npunished with death. \n \n \n304. \n \n \nPunishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. \n \n \n     304. Punishment  for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.-- \nWhoever commits  culpable homicide  not amounting  to murder  shall be \npunished with  1*[imprisonment for life], or imprisonment   of  either \ndescription for  a term  which may extend to ten years, and shall also \nbe liable  to fine,  if the  act by  which the death is caused is done \nwith the  intention of causing death. or of causing such bodily injury \nas is likely to cause death; \n \n     or with  imprisonment of  either description for a term which may \nextend to  ten years,  or with  fine, or with both, if the act is done \nwith the  knowledge that  it is likely to cause death, but without any \nintention to  cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely \nto cause death. \n \n \n304A. \n \n \nCausing death by negligence. \n \n \n     2*[304A.

Criminal  force.--Whoever intentionally  uses force  to  any \nperson, without  that person's  consent, in order to the committing of \nany offence,  or intending  by the  use of  such force  to  cause,  or \nknowing it  to be  likely that  by the use of such force he will cause \ninjury, fear  or annoyance to the person to whom the force is used, is \nsaid to use criminal force to that other. \n \n                            Illustrations \n \n     (a) Z  is sitting  in a  moored boat  on a river. A unfastens the \nmoorings, and  thus intentionally  causes the  boat to  drift down the \nstream. Here  A intentionally  causes motion to Z, and he does this by \ndisposing substances  in such  a manner  that the  motion is  produced \nwithout any  other action  on  any  person's  part.  A  has  therefore \nintentionally used  force to  Z; and  if he  has done  so without  Z's \nconsent, in  order to  the committing  of any offence, or intending or \nknowing it to be likely that this use of force will cause injury, fear \nor annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \n \n     (b) Z  is riding  in a  chariot. A  lashes Z's horses and thereby \ncauses them  to quicken their pace. Here A has caused change of motion \nto Z  by inducing  the animals to change their motion. A has therefore \nused force to Z; and if A has done this without Z's consent, intending \nor knowing  it to  be likely  that he  may thereby injure, frighten or \nannoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \n \n     (c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the \npole and stops the palanquin. Here A has caused cessation of motion to \nZ, and  he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used \nforce to  Z; and  as A  has  acted  thus  intentionally,  without  Z's \nconsent,  in  order to  the commission  of  an  offence.  A  has  used \ncriminal force to Z. \n \n     (d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by \nhis own  bodily power  moved his  own person  so as  to bring  it into \ncontact with Z. He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if \nhe has  done so  without Z's  consent, intending  or  knowing it to be \nlikely that  he may  thereby injure,  frighten or annoy Z, he has used \ncriminal force to Z. \n \n     (e) A  throws a  stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that \nthe stone  will be  thus brought  into contact  with Z,  or  with  Z's \nclothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water, \nand dash  up the  water against Z's clothes or something carried by Z. \nHere, if  the throwing  of the stone produce the effect of causing any \nsubstance to  come into  contact with  Z, or  Z's clothes,  A has used \nforce to Z, and if he did so without Z's consent, intending thereby to \ninjure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z. \n \n     (f) A intentionally pulls up a Woman's veil. Here A intentionally \nuses force  to her, and if he does so without her consent intending or \nknowing it  to be     likely that  he may  thereby injure, frighten or \nannoy her, he has used criminal force to her. \n \n     (g) Z  is bathing.  A pours into the bath water which he knows to \nbe boiling.  Here A  intentionally by his own bodily power causes such \nmotion in  the boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, \nor with  other water  so situated  that such  contact must  affect Z's \nsense of  feeling, A  has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and \nif he  has done this without Z's consent intending or knowing it to be \nlikely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has \nused criminal force. \n \n179 \n \n     (h) A  incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z's consent. Here, \nif A  intends to  cause injury,  fear  or  annoyance  to  Z,  he  uses \ncriminal force to Z. \n \n \n351. \n \n \nAssault. \n \n \n     351. Assault.--Whoever  makes any  gesture,  or  any  preparation \nintending or  knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation \nwill cause  any person  present to  apprehend that  he who  makes that \ngesture or  preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, \nis said to commit an assault. \n \n     Explanation.-Mere words  do not  amount to  an assault.  But  the \nwords which a person uses may give to his gestures or preparation such \na meaning  as may  make those  gestures or  preparations amount  to an \nassault. \n \n                            Illustrations \n \n     (a) A  shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely \nthat he  may thereby cause Z to believe that A is about to strike Z. A \nhas committed an assault. \n \n     (b) A  begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending \nor knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that \nhe is  about to  cause the dog to attack Z. A has committed an assault \nupon Z. \n \n     (c) A takes up a stick, saying to Z, \"I will give you a beating\". \nHere, though  the words  used by  A could  in no  case  amount  to  an \nassault, and  though the  mere gesture,  unaccompanied  by  any  other \ncircumstances, might not amount to an assault,the gesture explained by \nthe words may amount to an assault. \n \n \n352. \n \n \nPunishment for  assault or  criminal force  otherwise  than  on  grave \nprovocation. \n \n \n     352. Punishment  for assault  or criminal force otherwise than on \ngrave provocation.--Whoever  assaults or  uses criminal  force to  any \nperson otherwise  than on  grave and  sudden provocation given by that \nperson, shall  be punished with imprisonment of either description for \na term which may extend to three months, or with fine which may extend \nto five hundred rupees, or with both. \n \n     Explanation.-Grave and  sudden provocation  will not mitigate the \npunishment for  an offence  under this  section, if the provocation is \nsought or  voluntarily provoked  by the  offender as an excuse for the \noffence, or \n \n     if the  provocation is given by anything done in obedience to the \nlaw, or  by a  public servant, in the lawful exercise of the powers of \nsuch public servant, or \n \n     if the  provocation is  given by  anything  done  in  the  lawful \nexercise of the right of private defence. \n \n     Whether the  provocation was  grave and sudden enough to mitigate \nthe offence, is a question of fact. \n \n \n353. \n \n \nAssault or  criminal force  to deter  public servant from discharge of \nhis duty. \n \n \n     353.

Theft.--Whoever,  intending to  take dishonestly any movable \nproperty out  of the  possession of  any person  without that person's \nconsent, moves  that property  in order  to such  taking, is  said  to \ncommit theft. \n \n     Explanation 1.-A  thing so  long as  it is attached to the earth, \nnot  being  movable  property, is not the subject of  theft;   but  it \nbecomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed \nfrom the earth. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n1.   Subs, by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and Sch., for \"transportation for \n     life \". \n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n187 \n \n     Explanation 2.-A  moving effected  by the  same act which effects \nthe severance may be a theft. \n \n     Explanation 3.-A  person is  said to  cause a  thing to  move  by \nremoving an  obstacle which  prevented it from moving or by separating \nit from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it. \n \n     Explanation 4.-A  person, who  by any  means causes  an animal to \nmove, is  said to  move that  animal, and to move everything which, in \nconsequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal. \n \n     Explanation 5.-The  consent mentioned  in the  definition may  be \nexpress or  implied,  and  may  be  given  either  by  the  person  in \npossession, or  by any person having for that purpose authority either \nexpress or implied. \n \n                            Illustrations \n \n     (a) A  cuts down  a tree  on Z's  ground, with  the intention  of \ndishonestly taking the tree out of Z's possession without Z's consent. \nHere, as  soon as  A has  severed the tree in order to such taking, he \nhas committed theft. \n \n     (b) A  puts a  bait for  dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z's \ndog to  follow it.  Here, if  A's intention be dishonestly to take the \ndog out  of Z's  possession without Z's consent, A has committed theft \nas soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A. \n \n     (c) A  meets a  bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the \nbullock in  a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take \nthe treasure.  As soon  as the bullock begins to move, A has committed \ntheft of the treasure. \n \n     (d) A  being Z's servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's \nplate, dishonestly  runs away  with the  plate, without Z's consent. A \nhas committed theft. \n \n     (e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of \na warehouse,  till Z  shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith \nand sells  it. Here  the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not \ntherefore be  taken out  of Z's  possession, and  A has  not committed \ntheft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. \n \n     (f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z \noccupies. Here  the ring  is in  Z's possession,  and if A dishonestly \nremoves it, A commits theft. \n \n     (g) A  finds a ring lying on the high-road, not in the possession \nof any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit \ncriminal misappropriation of property. \n \n     (h) A  sees a  ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. \nNot venturing  to misappropriate  the ring  immediately  for  fear  of \nsearch and  detection, A  hides the ring in a place where it is highly \nimprobable that  it will  ever be  found by  Z, with  the intention of \ntaking the  ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is \nforgotten. Here  A, at  the time  of first  moving the  ring,  commits \ntheft. \n \n     (i) A  delivers his  watch to  Z, a  jeweller, to be regulated. Z \ncarries it  to his  shop. A,  not owing  to the  jeweller any debt for \nwhich the  jeweller might  lawfully detain  the watch  as a  security, \nenters the  shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, and \ncarries it  away. Here  A,  though  he  may  have  committed  criminal \ntrespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did \nwas not done dishonestly. \n \n188 \n \n     (j) If  A owes  money to  Z for  repairing the  watch, and  if  Z \nretains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the \nwatch out  of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the \nproperty as  a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he \ntakes it dishonestly. \n \n     (k) Again,  if A,  having pawned  his watch to Z, takes it out of \nZ's possession  without Z's  consent, not having paid what he borrowed \non the  watch, he  commits theft, though the watch is his own property \ninasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \n \n     (l) A  takes an  article belonging  to Z  out of  Z's  possession \nwithout Z's consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains \nmoney  from   Z  as  a  reward  for  its  restoration.  Here  A  takes \ndishonestly; A has therefor committed theft. \n \n     (m) A,  being on  friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in \nZ's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express consent for the \npurpose merely  of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. \nHere, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z's implied \nconsent to  use Z's  book. If  this was  A's  impression,  A  has  not \ncommitted theft. \n \n     (n) A  asks charity  from Z's  wife. She  gives A money, food and \nclothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable \nthat A  may conceive that Z's wife is authorized to give away alms. If \nthis was A's impression, A has not committed theft. \n \n     (o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, \nwhich A  knows to  belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as \nshe has  not authority  from Z  to  give.  If  A  takes  the  property \ndishonestly, he commits theft. \n \n     (p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's \nown property,  takes that  property out  of B's possession. Here, as A \ndoes not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. \n \n \n379. \n \n \nPunishment for theft. \n \n \n     379.  Punishment  for  theft.--Whoever  commits  theft  shall  be \npunished with  imprisonment of either description for a term which may \nextend to three years, or with fine, or with both. \n \n \n380. \n \n \nTheft in dwelling house, etc. \n \n \n     380.

A has committed the offence defined in this section. \n \n189 \n \n     (b) A  picks Z's  pocket, having posted several of his companions \nnear him, in order that they may restrain Z, if Z should perceive what \nis passing and should  resist, or should attempt to apprehend A. A has \ncommitted the offence defined in this section. \n \n                             Of extortion \n \n \n383. \n \n \nExtortion. \n \n \n     383.

He thus  induces Z  to  give  him  money.  A  has \ncommitted extortion. \n \n     (b) A  threatens Z  that he  will  keep  Z's  child  in  worngful \nconfinement, unless  Z will  sign and  deliver to  A a promissory note \nbinding Z to pay certain monies to A to Z sings and delivers the note. \nA has committed extortion. \n \n     (c) A  threatens to send club-men to plough up Z's field unless Z \nwill sign and deliver to B a bond binding Z under a penalty to deliver \ncertain  produce  to B, and thereby induces Z to sign and deliver  the \nbond.  A has committed extortion. \n \n     (d) A, by putting Z in fear of grievous hurt, dishonestly induces \nZ to  sign or  affix his  seal to a blank paper and deliver it to A. Z \nsings and delivers the paper to A. Here, as the paper so signed may be \nconverted into a valuable security A has committed extortion. \n \n \n384. \n \n \nPunishment for extortion. \n \n \n     384.

A,  in order to defraud B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and makes the \nsum 1,00,000  intending that  it may  be believed by B that Z so wrote \nthe letter. A has committed forgery. \n \n     (b) A  without Z's  authority, affixes  Z's seal  to  a  document \npurporting to  be a  conveyance of  an estate  from Z  to A,  with the \nintention of  selling the  estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B \nthe purchase-money. A has committed forgery. \n \n     (c) A  picks up  a cheque  on a  banker signed  by B,  payable to \nbearer, but  without any  sum having  been inserted  in the  cheque. A \nfraudulently fills  up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand \nrupees. A commits forgery. \n \n     (d) A  leaves with  B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by \nA, without  inserting the  sum payable and authorizes B to fill up the \ncheque by  inserting a  sum not  exceeding ten thousand rupees for the \npurpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque \nby inserting the sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery. \n \n     (e) A  draws a  bill of  exchange on  himself in  the name  of  B \nwithout B's authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with \na banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A \ndraws the  bill with  intent to  deceive the  banker by leading him to \nsuppose that  he had  the security  of B,  and thereby to discount the \nbill, A is guilty of forgery. \n \n     (f) Z's will contains these words-\"I direct that all my remaining \nproperty be  equally divided  between  A,  B  and  C.\"  A  dishonestly \nscratches out  B's name,  intending that  it may  be believed that the \nwhole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery. \n \n     (g) A  endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable \nto Z< for his  order by writing on the bill the words \"Pay to Z or his \norder\" and  signing the  endorsement. B  dishonestly erases  the words \n\"Pay to  Z or his order\", and thereby converts the special endorsement \ninto a blank endorsement. B commits forgery. \n \n     (h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to \ndefraud Z  of his  estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to \nB, dated  six months  earlier than  the date  of the  conveyance to Z, \nintending it  to be  believed that  he had  conveyed the  estate to  B \nbefore he conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery. \n \n     (i) Z  dictates his  will to  A. A  intentionally writes  down  a \ndifferent legatee  named by  Z, and  by representing  to Z that he has \nprepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the \nwill. A has committed forgery. \n \n     (j) A  writes a  letter and  signs it  with B's  name without B's \nauthority, certifying  that A  is a  man  of  good  character  and  in \ndistressed circumstances  from  unforeseen  misfortune,  intending  by \nmeans of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as \nA made  a false document in order to induce Z to part with property, A \nhas committed forgery. \n \n     (k) A  without B's  authority writes a letter and signs it in B's \nname  certifying   to  A's  character,  intending  thereby  to  obtain \nemployment under Z. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to \ndeceive Z  by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter \ninto an express or implied contract for service. \n \n205 \n \n     Explanation I.-A  man's signature  of his  own name may amount to \nforgery. \n \n                            Illustrations \n \n     (a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it \nmay be  believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same \nname. A has committed forgery. \n \n     (b) A writes the word \"accepted\" on a piece of paper and signs it \nwith Z's  name, in  order that  B may  afterwards write on the paper a \nbill of  exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bills as though \nit had  been accepted  by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing \nthe fact,  draws the  bill upon the paper pursuant to A's intention, B \nis also guilty of forgery. \n \n     (c) A  picks up  a bill  of exchange  payable to  the order  of a \ndifferent person  of the  same name.  A endorses  the bill  in his own \nname, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the \nperson to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery. \n \n     (d) A  purchases an  estate sold  under  execution  of  a  decree \nagainst B.  B, after  the seizure  of the estate, in collusion with Z, \nexecutes a  lease of  the estate to Z at a nominal rent and for a long \nperiod and  dates the  lease six  months prior  to the  seizure,  with \nintent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was \ngranted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own \nname, commits forgery by antedating it. \n \n     (e) A,  a trader,  in anticipation  of insolvency, lodges effects \nwith B  for A's benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; and \nin order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note \nbinding himself  to pay  to B  a sum for value received, and antedates \nthe note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before A \nwas on  the point  of insolvency.  A has  committed forgery  under the \nfirst head of the definition. \n \n     Explanation 2.-The  making of  a false  document in the name of a \nfictious person,  intending it  to be  believed that  the document was \nmade by real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it \nto be  believed that  the document  was made  by  the  person  in  his \nlifetime, may amount to forgery. \n \n                             Illustration \n \n     A  draws   a  bill  of  exchange  upon  a  fictious  person,  and \nfraudulently accepts  the bill  in the  name of such fictitious person \nwith intent to negotiate it.

        "extracted_text": "Judiciary in India Overview Presentation \nIntroduction to Judiciary \u2022 Judiciary is an independent branch of government.\n\u2022 Responsible for interpreting the Constitution.\n\u2022 Ensures justice and equality for all citizens.\n\u2022 Acts as guardian of Fundamental Rights.\n\u2022 Prevents misuse of authority by government.\n\u2022 Functions through courts at multiple levels.\n\u2022 Ensures rule of law in the nation.\n\u2022 Plays vital role in maintaining democracy. \nStructure of Indian Judiciary \u2022 Supreme Court at the top.\n\u2022 High Courts at the state level.\n\u2022 District and Sessions Courts in districts.\n\u2022 Subordinate courts at lower levels.\n\u2022 Unified and integrated judicial system.\n\u2022 Supreme Court decisions binding on all.\n\u2022 High Courts supervise lower courts.\n\u2022 Hierarchy ensures smooth functioning. \n\nHierarchy of Judiciary in India \n\nThe Supreme Court The Supreme Court has \noriginal, \nAppellate, \nwrit and \nAdvisory Jurisdictions\n \nJurisdiction of High Court Every High Court enjoys original jurisdiction with respect to revenue and its collection, cases of succession, divorce etc.\nIn its appellate Jurisdiction, it hears appeals from the lower courts in cases concerning sales-tax, income tax, copy right, patent-right etc. The High Court is a court of record and its proceedings and decisions are referred to in future cases.\nA High court can issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights or for any other such purpose.\nA High Court supervises the working of all subordinate courts and frames rules and regulations for the transaction of business.\nThe High Court is empowered to interpret the constitution of India. It can review the laws of the State Legislature and may declare them null and void if they go against the provisions of the constitution.\nAgain, if a High court is satisfied that a case pending in a lower court involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the constitution, it my dispose of the case itself.\n \nSubordinate courts There are subordinate courts below the High court in each state.\nThe courts are under the complete control of the High court. The lower court (e.g. Nyaya Panchayat or Munsiffs court) deals with minor cases while the higher courts (e.g., subordinate Judge\u2019s court or District Judge\u2019s court) deal with important cases.\nAppeals lie to the higher courts from the lower courts. An appeal may also lie to the High Court against the decisions of the District judge\u2019s court or the Session Judge\u2019s court.\nIn a Presidency town, there are city civil courts and Metropolitan Magistrates courts.\nIn this connection, we are to note that most of the Judges of the subordinate courts are appointed by the Governor in consultation with the High Court of the concerned State.\n \n Salient Features of Indian Judiciary \nThe Constitution establishes a single integrated judicial system for the whole of India. \nThe Supreme Court of India is the highest court of the country and below it are the High Courts at the state level. \nOther courts (Subordinate Courts) work under the High Courts. \nThe Supreme Court controls and runs the judicial administration of India. \nAll courts in India form links of a single judicial system.\n 1. Single and Integrated Judicial System \n2. Independence of Judiciary:  The Constitution of India makes judiciary truly independent.\nIt provides for:\n\n (i) Appointment of judges by the President,\n(ii) High qualifications for appointment as judges,\n(iii) Removal of judges by a difficult method of impeachment,\n(iv) High salaries, pension and other service benefits for judges,\n (v) Independent establishment for the Judiciary, and\n(vi) Adequate powers and functional autonomy for the Judiciary.\n\nAll these features together make the Indian Judiciary an independent judiciary. \n3. Judiciary as the Interpreter of the Constitution The Constitution of India is a written and enacted constitution. \nThe right to interpret and clarify the Constitution has been given to the Supreme Court. \nIt is the final interpreter of the provisions of the Constitution of India. \n4. Judicial Review The Constitution of India is the supreme law of the land. \nThe Supreme Court acts as the interpreter and protector of the Constitution. \nIt is the guardian of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the people.\n For performing this role, it exercises the power of judicial review. \nThe Supreme Court has the power to determine the constitutional validity of all laws. \nIt can reject any such law which is held to be unconstitutional. High Courts also exercise this power.\n \n5. High Court for each states as well a Provision for Joint High Courts The Constitution lays down that there is to be a High Court for each state. \nHowever, two or more states can, by mutual consent, have a Joint High Court. \n6. Supreme Court as the Arbiter of legal disputes between the Union and States The Constitution gives to the Supreme Court the jurisdiction in all cases of disputes: \n(i) Between the Government of India and one or more states,\n(ii) Between the Government of India and any state or states on one side and one or more states on the other, and\n(iii) Between two or more states. \n7. Guardian of Fundamental Rights Indian judiciary acts as the guardian of fundamental rights and freedoms of the people. \nThe people have the Right to Constitutional Remedies under which they can seek the protection of the courts for preventing a violation or for meeting any threat to their rights. \nThe Supreme Court and the High Courts have the power to issue writs for this purpose.\n \n8. Separation of Judiciary from the Executive The Constitution of India provides for a separation between the judiciary and the other two organs of the government. \nThe judiciary is neither a branch of the executive nor in any way subordinate to it. \nThe judicial administration in India is oraganised and run in accordance with the rules and orders of the Supreme Court. \n9. Open Trial The courts in India are free. \nThese conduct open trials. \nThe accused is always given full opportunity to defend himself. \nThe state provides free legal aid to the poor and needy. \n10. Judicial Activism Indian Judicial System has been becoming more and more active. \nThe Supreme Court has been coming out with judicial decisions and directives aimed at active protection of public interest and human rights. \nJudiciary has been giving directives to public officials for ensuring a better security for the rights of the public. \nThe Public Interest Litigation system has been picking up. The system of Lok Adalats has also taken a proper shape and health.\n \n11. Public Interest Litigation System Under this system the courts of law in India can initiate and enforce action for securing any significant public or general interest which is being adversely affected or is likely to be so by the action of any agency, public or private. Under it any citizen or a group or a voluntary organisation, or even a court herself, can bring to notice any case demanding action for protecting and satisfying a public interest.\nIt provides for an easy, simple, speedier and less expensive system of providing judicial relief to the aggrieved public. With all these features, the Indian Judicial System is an independent, impartial, free, powerful and efficient judicial system."

State of Kerala & Anr. [ 1 ] Decided 24 April 1973 Citations 1973 Supp. (1) S.C.R. 1 ; 1973 INSC 91; (1973) 4 SCC 225; AIR 1973 SC 1461; Court membership Judges sitting Sikri , C. J., A. N.

Chandrachud Case opinions There are certain principles within the framework of Indian Constitution which form its ' basic structure '. These principles are inviolable and hence cannot be amended by Parliament. Majority Sikri , C. J.; Hegde and Mukherjea, JJ.; Shelat and Grover, JJ.; Jaganmohan Reddy, J.; Khanna, J. Dissent Ray, J. ; Palekar, J.; Mathew, J.; Beg, J.; Dwivedi, J.; Chandrachud, J. Laws applied This case overturned a previous ruling I.C. Golaknath and Ors. v. State of Punjab and Anrs. (1967) His Holiness Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru & Ors. v. State of Kerala & Anr. (Writ Petition (Civil) 135 of 1970), also known as the Kesavananda Bharati judgement , was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of India that outlined the basic structure doctrine of the Indian Constitution . [ 2 ] The case is also known as the Fundamental Rights Case. The court in a 7-6 decision asserted its right to strike down amendments to the constitution that were in violation of the fundamental architecture of the constitution. [ 3 ] Justice Hans Raj Khanna argued that the Constitution possesses a basic structure of constitutional principles and values. The Court partially cemented the prior precedent Golaknath v. State of Punjab , which held that constitutional amendments through Article 368 were subject to fundamental rights review, but only if they could affect the 'basic structure of the Constitution'. At the same time, the Court also upheld the constitutionality of the first provision of Article 31-C, which implied that laws seeking to implement the Directive Principles , which do not affect the 'Basic Structure,' shall not be subjected to judicial review. The doctrine forms the basis of power of the Indian judiciary to review and override amendments to the Constitution of India enacted by the Indian parliament . The 13-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court deliberated on the limitations, if any, of the powers of the elected representatives of the people and the nature of fundamental rights of an individual. In a verdict divided 7\u20136, the court held that while the Parliament has 'wide' powers, it did not have the power to destroy or emasculate the basic elements or fundamental features of the constitution. [ 2 ] When this case was decided, the underlying apprehension of the majority bench that elected representatives could not be trusted to act responsibly was unprecedented. The Kesavananda judgment also defined the extent to which Parliament could restrict property rights , in pursuit of land reform and the redistribution of large landholdings to cultivators, overruling previous decisions that suggested that the right to property could not be restricted. The case was a culmination of a series of cases relating to limitations to the power to amend the Constitution. Facts [ edit ] See also: Sri Kesavananda Bharati and Edneer Mutt Kesavananda Bharati (center) at the Kumbh Mela in February 2013. In February 1970 Swami Kesavananda Bharati , senior pontiff and head of the Hindu monastery Edneer Matha in Edneer , Kasaragod District , Kerala , challenged the Kerala government 's attempts, under two land reform acts, to impose restrictions on the management of its property. A noted Indian jurist, Nanabhoy Palkhivala , convinced Swami into filing his petition under Article 26, concerning the right to manage religiously owned property without government interference. The case had been heard for 68 days, the arguments commencing on October 31, 1972, and ending on March 23, 1973, and its judgement consists of 700 pages. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Judgement [ edit ] The Supreme Court reviewed the decision in Golaknath v. State of Punjab , and considered the validity of the article 24th, 25th, 26th and 29th amendments. The case was heard by the largest ever Constitution Bench of 13 Judges. The bench gave eleven separate judgments, which agreed in some points and differed on others. [ 11 ] Nanabhoy Palkhivala , assisted by Fali Nariman and Soli Sorabjee , presented the case against the government in both cases. [ 12 ] Majority judgement [ edit ] Upholding the validity of clause 1 of article 13 and a corresponding provision in article 368(3), inserted by the 24th Amendment, the Court settled in favour of the view that Parliament has the power to amend the fundamental rights. However, the Court affirmed another proposition also asserted in the Golaknath case, by ruling that the expression \"amendment\" of this Constitution in article 368 means any addition or change in any of the provisions of the Constitution within the broad contours of the Preamble and the Constitution to carry out the objectives in the Preamble and the Directive Principles. Applied to fundamental rights, it would be that while fundamental rights cannot be abrogated, reasonable abridgement of fundamental rights could be affected in the public interest. The true position is that every provision of the Constitution can be amended provided the basic foundation and structure of the Constitution remains the same. [ 11 ] The nine signatories to the statement were Chief Justice S M Sikri J. M. Shelat K. S. Hegde A. N. Grover P. Jaganmohan Reddy D. G. Palekar H R Khanna A. K. Mukherjee Y.V. Chandrachud . Four judges did not sign the judgment A. N. Ray , K. K. Mathew M. H. Beg S. N. Dwivedi . [ 13 ] S.M. Sikri, Chief Justice [ edit ] CJI S M Sikri held that the fundamental importance of the freedom of the individual has to be preserved for all times to come and that it could not be amended out of existence. According to the Chief Justice, fundamental rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution of India cannot be abrogated, though a reasonable abridgment of those rights could be effected in public interest. There is a limitation on the power of amendment by necessary implication which was apparent from a reading of the preamble and therefore, according to the learned Chief Justice, the expression 'amendment of this Constitution,' in Article 368 , means any addition or change in any of the provisions of the Constitution within the broad contours of the preamble, made in order to carry out the basic objectives of the Constitution. Accordingly, every provision of the Constitution was open to amendment provided the basic foundation or structure of the Constitution was not damaged or destroyed. Shelat and Grover, JJ [ edit ] Held that the preamble to the Constitution contains the clue to the fundamentals of the Constitution. According to the learned Judges, Parts III and IV of the Constitution which respectively embody the fundamental rights and the directive principles have to be balanced and harmonised. This balance & harmony between two integral parts of the Constitution forms a basic element of the Constitution which cannot be altered. The word 'amendment' occurring in Article 368 must therefore be construed in such a manner as to preserve the power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution, but not so as to result in damaging or destroying the structure and identity of the Constitution. There was thus an implied limitation on the amending power which prevented the Parliament from abolishing or changing the identity of the Constitution or any of its Basic Structure. Hegde and Mukherjea, JJ [ edit ] Held that the Constitution of India which is essentially a social rather than a political document, is founded on a social philosophy and as such has two main features basic and circumstantial. The basic constituent remained constant, the circumstantial was subject to change. According to the learned Judges, the broad contours of the basic elements and the fundamental features of the Constitution are delineated in the preamble and the Parliament has no power to abolish or emasculate those basic elements of fundamental features. The building of a welfare State is the ultimate goal of every Government but that does not mean that in order to build a welfare State, human freedoms have to suffer a total destruction. Applying these tests, the learned Judges invalidated Article 31C even in its un-amended form. Jaganmohan Reddy, J [ edit ] Held that the word 'amendment' was used in the sense of permitting a change, in contradistinction to destruction, which the repeal or abrogation brings about. Therefore, the width of the power of amendment could not be enlarged by amending the amending power itself. The learned Judge held that the essential elements of the basic structure of the Constitution are reflected in its preamble and that some of the important features of the Constitution are justice, freedom of expression and equality of status and opportunity. The word 'amendment' could not possibly embrace the right to abrogate the pivotal features and the fundamental freedoms and therefore, that part of the basic structure could not be damaged or destroyed. According to the learned Judge, the provisions of Article 31d, as they, conferring power on Parliament and the State Legislatures to enact laws for giving effect to the principles specified in Clauses (b) and (c) of Article 39, altogether abrogated the right given by Article 14 and were for that reason unconstitutional. In conclusion, the learned Judge held that though the power of amendment was wide, it did not comprehend the power to totally abrogate or emasculate or damage any of the fundamental rights or the essential elements of the basic structure of the Constitution or to destroy the identity of the Constitution. Subject to these limitations, Parliament had the right to amend any and every provision of the Constitution. H R Khanna J. [ edit ] H R Khanna has given in his judgment that the Parliament had full power to amend the Constitution, however, since it is only a 'power to amend,' the basic structure or framework of the structure should remain intact. While as per the aforesaid views of the six learned Judges, certain \"essential elements\" (which included fundamental rights) of the judgment cannot be amended as there are certain implied restrictions on the powers of the parliament of India. According to the Judge, although it was permissible for the Parliament to effect changes in the exercise of its amending power so as to meet the requirements of changing conditions, it was not permissible to touch the foundation or to alter the basic institutional pattern. Therefore, the words 'amendment of the Constitution' in spite of the width of their sweep and in spite of their amplitude, could not have the effect of empowering the Parliament to destroy or abrogate the basic structure or framework of the Constitution. This gave birth to the basic structure doctrine , which has been considered as the cornerstone of the Constitutional law in India. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Significance [ edit ] The government of Indira Gandhi did not take kindly to this restriction on its powers by the court. On 26 April 1973, Justice Ajit Nath Ray , who was among the dissenters, was promoted to Chief Justice of India superseding three senior Judges, Shelat, Grover and Hegde, which was unprecedented in Indian legal history. [ 16 ] The 42nd Amendment , enacted in 1976, is considered to be the immediate and most direct fall out of the judgment. Apart from it, the judgement cleared the deck for complete legislative authority to amend any part of the Constitution except when the amendments are not in consonance with the basic features of the Constitution. In the 1980 case Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain , a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court used the basic structure doctrine to strike down the 39th amendment. The 39th Amendment was passed in 1975, during The Emergency and placed the election of the President , the Vice President , the Prime Minister and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha beyond the scrutiny of the Indian courts. [ 17 ] [ 14 ] Adopting this amendment was a move to suppress Gandhi's prosecution. The basic structure doctrine was also adopted by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh in 1989, by expressly relying on the reasoning in the Kesavananda case, in its ruling on Anwar Hossain Chowdhary v. Bangladesh (41 DLR 1989 App. Div. 165, 1989 BLD (Spl.) 1). [ 18 ] See also [ edit ] Indian law Basic structure doctrine Edneer Edneer Mutt Sri Kesavananda Bharati Nanabhoy Palkhivala I.C.

Union of India , AIR 1978 SC 597, was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of India that significantly expanded the interpretation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India . The Court overruled A. K. Gopalan v. State of Madras which had held that fundamental rights were exclusive and independent of each other. Instead, the Court established that Articles 14, 19, and 21 were interlinked, forming what is known as the 'golden triangle' of the Constitution. [ 1 ] :\u200a222 It held that any law depriving a person of \"personal liberty\" must satisfy all three provisions. [ 1 ] :\u200a220 The Court further ruled that the 'procedure established by law' under Article 21 must be just, fair, and reasonable, rejecting earlier interpretations that allowed arbitrary or oppressive state action. [ 1 ] :\u200a220 This decision marked a fundamental shift in Indian constitutional law, prioritizing individual rights over a restrictive reading of state power and underlining the importance of 'due process of law'. [ 2 ] Legal scholars have described the ruling as a turning point in Indian jurisprudence, signaling a move away from formalistic interpretations and toward a more rights-expanding approach. As one scholar noted, Maneka Gandhi marked the moment when the Supreme Court \"inaugurated a new path where Courts would expand the rights of individuals against the State, instead of limiting or contracting them.\" [ 3 ] Background [ edit ] Maneka Gandhi 's passport was impounded \"in the public interest\" by an order dated 2 July 1977. [ 4 ] :\u200a273 When she requested reasons for the impoundment, the Government of India declined to provide any, citing \"the interests of the general public.\" [ 4 ] :\u200a273 Gandhi filed a written petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, challenging the order on the grounds that it violated her fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19, and 21. In its written submission, the Union government stated that her passport was impounded because her presence in India was likely to be required in connection with legal proceedings before a Commission of Inquiry. Judgement [ edit ] Justice P. N. Bhagwati delivered the judgment for a plurality of the Court, writing for himself, along with Justices Untwalia and Fazal Ali . [ 4 ] :\u200a273 Chief Justice Beg, [ 4 ] :\u200a390 Justice Chandrachud, [ 4 ] :\u200a322 and Justice Krishna Iyer wrote separate concurring judgments. [ 4 ] :\u200a328 Justice Kailasam wrote a dissenting opinion. [ 4 ] :\u200a350 The Court did not pass an order on the specific matter of Maneka Gandhi's passport, stating that \"[i]n view of the statement made by the Attorney-General that the Government is agreeable to consider any representation that may be made by the petitioner in respect of the impounding of her passport... it is not necessary to formally interfere with the impugned order...\" [ 4 ] :\u200a322 References [ edit ] ^ a b c Singh, Mahendra Pal (2019).

Naz Foundation by Supreme Court of India Keywords Criminalization of Homosexuality , Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation Navtej Singh Johar & Ors. v. Union of India thr. Secretary Ministry of Law and Justice (2018) is a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of India that decriminalised all consensual sex among adults, including homosexual sex. [ 1 ] The court was asked to determine the constitutionality of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code , a colonial-era law which, among other things, criminalised homosexual acts as an \"unnatural offence\". While the statute criminalises all anal sex and oral sex , including between opposite-sex couples, it largely affected same-sex relationships. [ 2 ] On 6 September 2018, the court unanimously declared the law unconstitutional \"in so far as it criminalises consensual sexual conduct between adults of the same sex\". [ 3 ] The verdict was hailed as a landmark decision for LGBT rights in India , with campaigners waiting outside the court cheering after the verdict was pronounced. [ 2 ] Elements of Section 377 relating to sex with minors , non-consensual sexual acts such as rape , and bestiality remain in force. [ 4 ] Background [ edit ] On 27 April 2016, five people, all members of the LGBT community themselves, filed a new writ petition in the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code . The petitioners claimed that the issues which they raised in their petition were varied and diverse from those raised in the pending curative petition in the 2013 Koushal v. Naz case, in which the Supreme Court had upheld the constitutionality of Section 377. The Naz Foundation had been earlier referred to a five-judge bench in order to decide whether the curative petition could be accepted for consideration. The petitioners were dancer Navtej Singh Johar , journalist Sunil Mehra, chef Ritu Dalmia , hoteliers Aman Nath and Keshav Suri, and businesswoman Ayesha Kapur. [ 5 ] This case was the first instance wherein the petitioners argued that they had all been directly aggrieved because of Section 377, alleging it to be a direct violation of their fundamental rights . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The opposition to decriminalisation petitions was led by Apostolic Alliance of Churches, Utkal Christian Council and Trust God Ministries. Advocate Manoj George represented the first two and Senior Advocate KS Radhakrishnan the third. The NDA government took a neutral stance, leaving the decision to the \"wisdom of the court\" as long as it applies to \"consensual acts of adults in private\". [ 8 ] Proceedings [ edit ] The petition was first placed before the former Chief Justice of India Justice T.S. Thakur , Justice S. A. Bobde and Justice A. K. Bhushan on 29 June 2016. An order was passed to post the matter before Justice Dipak Misra for appropriate orders since a curative petition was already pending before the constitution bench . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] On 8 January 2018, the case ( Navtej Singh Johar and others v. Union of India ) was listed to be heard by the Chief Justice's bench, which passed an order stating that the case would be heard by a constitution bench. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] The matter was heard from 17 January 2018 by a five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court. [ 14 ] On 10 July 2018, the SC commenced hearing of the pleas challenging the constitutionality of section 377. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] The bench ended its hearing on 17 July and reserved its verdict, asking for both sides to submit written submissions for their claims by 20 July. [ 18 ] Judgment [ edit ] The judgement of the Supreme Court of India of 6 September 2018 overturning its own verdict in Suresh Kumar Koushal vs. Naz Foundation hence declaring all private consensual sexual acts between adults legal including homosexual ones. On 6 September 2018, the court delivered its unanimous verdict, declaring portions of the law relating to consensual sexual acts between adults unconstitutional. [ 2 ] [ 19 ] The Bench unanimously found that the criminalisation of sexual acts between consenting adults to be violation of the Article 14, 15, 19, and 21 of Indian Constitution . [ 1 ] This decision overturns the 2013 ruling in Suresh Kumar Koushal v. Naz Foundation in which the court upheld the law. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] However, other portions of Section 377 relating to sex with minors , non-consensual sexual acts, and bestiality remain in force. [ 4 ] While reading the judgment, the then Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra pronounced that the court found \"criminalising carnal intercourse\" to be \"irrational, arbitrary and manifestly unconstitutional\". [ 2 ] The court ruled that LGBTQ people in India are entitled to all constitutional rights, including the liberties protected by the Constitution of India . [ 1 ] It held that \"the choice of whom to partner, the ability to find fulfilment in sexual intimacies and the right not to be subjected to discriminatory behaviour are intrinsic to the constitutional protection of sexual orientation\". [ 1 ] In his concurring opinion, Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, observing the discrimination, stigmatisation and marginalisation of sexual and gender minorities due to dominance of endosex , heterosexual and cisgender norms, said [ 1 ] Individuals belonging to sexual and gender minorities experience discrimination, stigmatization, and, in some cases, denial of care on account of their sexual orientation and gender identity. However, it is important to note that \u2018sexual and gender minorities\u2019 do not constitute a homogenous group, and experiences of social exclusion, marginalization, and discrimination, as well as specific health needs, vary considerably. Nevertheless, these individuals are united by one factor - that their exclusion, discrimination and marginalization is rooted in societal heteronormativity and society\u2019s pervasive bias towards gender binary and opposite-gender relationships, which marginalizes and excludes all non-heteronormative sexual and gender identities. \u2014\u200apara. 72, page 93 In her concurring opinion, Justice Indu Malhotra , acknowledging historical discrimination and apologizing for delay in redressal, said [ 1 ] History owes an apology to the members of this community and their families, for the delay in providing redressal for the ignominy and ostracism that they have suffered through the centuries. The members of this community were compelled to live a life full of fear of reprisal and persecution. This was on account of the ignorance of the majority to recognise that homosexuality is a completely natural condition, part of a range of human sexuality. The mis-application of this provision denied them the Fundamental Right to equality guaranteed by Article 14. It infringed the Fundamental Right to non-discrimination under Article 15, and the Fundamental Right to live a life of dignity and privacy guaranteed by Article 21. The LGBT persons deserve to live a life unshackled from the shadow of being \u2018unapprehended felons\u2019. \u2014\u200apara 20, page 50 The judgement also made note that LGBT community is entitled to equal citizenship and protection under law, without discrimination. [ 1 ] Public opinion [ edit ] The Government of India decided to abstain from the hearings and had left the matter to the \"[w]isdom of the [c]ourt\". [ 20 ] Political parties and organisations [ edit ] The largest constituent party of the National Democratic Alliance , a right-wing coalition, currently having a majority in the Lok Sabha (House of the People), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was one of the few parties which officially stayed silent on the verdict. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Several party members did express their personal opinions on the subject, including the BJP spokesperson G. V. L. Narasimha Rao , who said that any decision on the matter \"takes in sync with the jurisprudential developments on gay rights the world over would be welcome\". [ 23 ] Meanwhile, Subramanian Swamy , a Rajya Sabha (Council of the States) member of the BJP, attacked the decision, questioning if the court will legalise sexual intercourse with animals in the name of personal liberty. [ 24 ] He was of the view that the decision could be overruled \"[i]f it leads to excesses, including paedophilia, gay bars, increase in HIV cases, etc.\" [ 25 ] The Prime Minister of India , Narendra Modi , has a record of saying relatively little about LGBT rights compared to other socio-political issues, and refused to comment on the same. [ 19 ] The right-wing organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh conveyed its agreement with the court's verdict as it didn't believe homosexuality was a crime, but did label the orientation as \"unnatural\". [ 26 ] In January 2018, the BJP's coalition partner, the Shiv Sena had supported legalisation, with its member and a member of parliament in Lok Sabha for Mumbai South , Arvind Sawant Ganpat saying, \"They have the right to live the way they want. What can we say on it.\" [ 23 ] The largest opposition party in India, the Indian National Congress of the United Progressive Alliance , issued a statement welcoming the ruling. The organisation remarked that the judgement should bring about \"the beginning of a more equal and inclusive society\". [ 2 ] This was in contrast to its previous objection in the same case in 2009 when it was in government during the initial Naz Foundation case, stating that gay sex was 'immoral' and that it cannot be decriminalised. [ 27 ] Overseas [ edit ] In terms of non-governmental organisations , the group Human Rights Watch welcomed what happened, with its South Asia director labelling the judgement as \"hugely significant\". [ 19 ] Amnesty International also praised the ruling. [ 28 ] The United Nations welcomed the judgement, hoping that it will be the first step towards guaranteeing the full range of fundamental rights to LGBTI persons. [ 29 ] Global News suggested that similar colonial laws in South Asia, modelled on India's Section 377, could be declared unconstitutional following this verdict. The agency stated that the ruling \"emboldened activists in neighbouring countries\". [ 30 ] In terms of LGBT rights in Sri Lanka , a similar law in that nation, which has not been enforced in decades, was declared unenforceable by its Supreme Court and is effectively dormant. However, differences in how constitutional matters are handled mean that the law cannot be removed without the consent of the electorate. [ 31 ] [ 30 ] Global News also noted that the nations of Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Pakistan face problems with LGBT people suffering from public discrimination, outside of the context of laws restricting homosexuality. [ 30 ] Simon Chesterman , dean of the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law , congratulated India on the verdict in a Facebook post. In response to Chesterman's post, Singaporean diplomat Tommy Koh wrote on Facebook that Singaporean LGBT activists should take the opportunity to overturn Section 377A of the Penal Code , [ 32 ] a position supported by Chief of Government Communications Janadas Devan . Later, on 10 September, disc jockey and producer Johnson Ong Ming filed a lawsuit in court against Section 377A. [ 33 ] However, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam stated that \u201c[t]his issue relates to social mores, values - so can you impose viewpoints on a majority when it so closely relates to a social value system?\u201d [ 34 ] Successive cases [ edit ] The case also opened the door for development of rights for same-sex couples through successive litigation. The case Deepika Singh v. Central Administrative Tribunal (2022) widened the definition of family under Indian law to include same-sex couples for the first time, ruling that families are deserving of equal protection under law guaranteed in the Article 14 of the Indian Constitution and benefits available under social welfare legislation. [ 35 ] However, the case Supriyo v. Union of India (2023) stopped short of ruling in favour a right to marriage, civil union or adoption for same-sex couples under existing law, instead placing the onus on Parliament and the Cabinet to pass successive legislation to define the rights of same-sex couples.

Nazeer Case opinions The right to privacy is protected under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution . Concurrence 6 separate concurring decisions Dissent None Laws applied This case overturned a previous ruling MP Sharma v Satish Chandra (1954) Kharak Singh v State of Uttar Pradesh and Others (1962) ADM Jabalpur v. Shivkant Shukla (1976) Justice K.S. Puttaswamy ( Retd. ) & Anr. vs. Union of India & Ors. (2017), commonly known as the Right to Privacy verdict , was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of India , which held that the right to privacy is protected as a fundamental right under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India . [ 1 ] The original petitioner Justice K.S. Puttaswamy was a former judge of the Karnataka High Court . A nine-judge bench of J. S. Khehar , J. Chelameswar , S. A. Bobde , R. K. Agrawal , R. F. Nariman , A. M. Sapre , D. Y. Chandrachud , S. K. Kaul , and S. A. Nazeer unanimously held that \"the right to privacy is protected as an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 and as a part of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution.\" [ 2 ] It explicitly overrules previous judgements of the Supreme Court in Kharak Singh vs. State of UP and M.P. Sharma vs. Union of India , which held that there is no fundamental right to privacy under the Indian Constitution. This judgement settled this position of law and clarified that the Right to Privacy could be infringed upon only when there was a compelling state interest for doing so. This position was the same as with the other fundamental rights. [ 3 ] Background [ edit ] After Facebook acquired WhatsApp in 2014, WhatsApp's new data sharing policy was challenged in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court had to decide if the right to privacy could be enforced against private entities. [ 4 ] A three-judge bench first heard the legal challenge to the \"Aadhaar card scheme\". Before this bench, Attorney General of India took a stand that the\u00a0 legal\u00a0 position\u00a0 regarding\u00a0 the existence of the fundamental right to\u00a0 privacy\u00a0 is\u00a0 doubtful in view of Supreme Court's earlier judgments. [ 5 ] On August 11, the three-judge bench referred the question of right to privacy to a larger bench. [ 3 ] [ 6 ] In October 2015, a five-judge constitution bench modified the order and allowed the central government's request to bring further services within the scope of Aadhaar. [ 6 ] The nine-judge bench was used because, when the case was on the list, Supreme Court Chief Justice Khehar was informed that in the past there was a verdict from an eight-judge bench as well as a six-judge bench, both holding the view that the Right to Privacy is not a fundamental right. CJI Khehar then decided to constitute a nine-judge bench to rule on the question of Right to Privacy. [ 7 ] This nine-judge bench gave a unanimous decision on the case, recognizing every individual's fundamental right to privacy under the Constitution. [ 3 ] In March 2016, Parliament of India passed the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016 as a money bill. Rajya Sabha MP Jairam Ramesh filed a fresh petition challenging the Act Aadhaar Act, 2016, claiming it to be \u201cunconstitutional\u201d for being passed as a money bill. [ 6 ] Hearing the case [ edit ] Attorney General K.K. Venugopal The Attorney General of India K.K. Venugopal had opposed the elevation of privacy as a fundamental right, representing the stance of the Union government of India in the Supreme Court. The previous Attorney General, Mukul Rohatgi , had opposed the right to privacy entirely, but Venugopal, while opposing the right, conceded that privacy could be a \"wholly qualified fundamental right.\" [ citation needed ] Judgment [ edit ] Justice DY Chandrachud, who authored the unanimous opinion On 24 August 2017, the Supreme Court of India gave the Right to Privacy verdict. In the case of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs Union of India and Ors. The Supreme Court held that the Right to Privacy is a fundamental right protected under Article 21 and Part III of the Indian Constitution. The judgment mentioned Section 377 as a \"discordant note which directly bears upon the evolution of the constitutional jurisprudence on the right to privacy.\" In the judgment delivered by the nine-judge bench, Justice Chandrachud (who authored for Justices Khehar , Agarwal , Abdul Nazeer and himself), held that the rationale behind the Suresh Koushal (2013) Judgement is incorrect, and the judges clearly expressed their disagreement with it. Justice Kaul agreed with Justice Chandrachud's view that the right to privacy cannot be denied, even if a minuscule fraction of the affected population exists. He went on to state that the majoritarian concept does not apply to Constitutional rights, and the courts are often called upon to take what may be categorized as a non-majoritarian view, in the check and balance of power envisaged under the Constitution of India. [ 8 ] Sexual orientation is an essential attribute of privacy. Discrimination against an individual based on sexual orientation is deeply offensive to an individual's dignity and self-worth. Equality demands that the sexual orientation of each individual in society must be protected on an even platform. The right to privacy and the protection of sexual orientation lie at the core of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14, 15, and 21 of the Constitution. [ 8 ] Their rights are not \"so-called\" but are real rights founded on sound constitutional doctrine. They inhere in the right to life. They dwell in privacy and dignity. They constitute the essence of liberty and freedom. Sexual orientation is an essential component of identity. Equal protection demands protecting the identity of every individual without discrimination. [ 8 ] The ADM Jabalpur case was overruled on the doctrinal grounds concerning the rights by the same verdict. At the paragraph 119 of the majority opinion, the court had ruled: [ 3 ] \"The judgments rendered by all the four judges constituting the majority in Additional District Magistrate, Jabalpur are seriously flawed. Life and personal liberty are inalienable to human existence. These rights are, as recognized in Kesavananda Bharati, primordial rights. They constitute rights under natural law. The human element in the life of the individual is integrally founded on the sanctity of life. Dignity is associated with liberty and freedom. No civilised state can contemplate an encroachment upon life and personal liberty without the authority of law. \"Neither life nor liberty are bounties conferred by the State nor does the Constitution create these rights. \"The right to life has existed even before the advent of the Constitution. In recognizing the right, the Constitution does not become the sole repository of the right. It would be preposterous to suggest that a democratic Constitution without a Bill of Rights would leave individuals governed by the State without either the existence of the right to live or the means of enforcement of the right. The right to life is inalienable to each individual, it existed before the Constitution and continued in force under Article of the Constitution. \"Justice Khanna was right in holding that the recognition of the right to life and personal liberty under the Constitution does not denude the existence of that right, apart from it nor can there be a fatuous assumption that in adopting the Constitution the people of India surrendered the most precious aspects of the human persona, namely, life, liberty and freedom to the State on whose mercy these rights would depend. Such a construct is contrary to the basic foundation of the rule of law which imposes restraints upon the powers vested in the modern state when it deals with individual liberties. \"The power of the Court to issue a writ of habeas corpus is a precious and undeniable feature of the rule of law.\" [ 3 ] Analysis [ edit ] A nine-judge bench ruled that the Right to Privacy is a fundamental right for Indian citizens, so no legislation passed by the government can unduly violate it. Specifically, the court adopted the three-pronged test required for any encroachment of Article 21 right: legality, or the existence of a certain law; necessity, in terms of a legitimate state objective; and proportionality, which requires a rational connection between an object and the means required to get that object. [ 9 ] This clarification was crucial to prevent dilution of the right in the future to the whims and fancies of the government in power. [ 10 ] The court adopted a liberal interpretation of the fundamental rights, holding that individual liberty must extend to digital spaces and individual autonomy, and privacy must be protected. [ 11 ] This judgment settled that position of law and clarified that the Right to Privacy could be infringed only when there was a compelling state interest for doing so. This position was the same as with the other fundamental rights. [ 3 ] This ruling by the Supreme Court paved the way for the decriminalization of homosexuality in India on 6 September 2018, thus legalizing same-sex sexual intercourse between two consenting adults in private. [ 12 ] India is the world's largest democracy and with this ruling has joined the United States, Canada, South Africa, the European Union, and the UK in recognizing this fundamental right. [ 13 ] However, as the curative petition (challenging Section 377) is currently sub-judice, the judges authored that they would leave the constitutional validity to be decided in an appropriate proceeding. Legal experts have suggested that with this judgment, the judges have invalidated the reasoning behind the 2013 Judgement, thus laying the groundwork for Section 377 to be read down and the restoration of the 2009 High Court Judgement, thereby decriminalizing homosexual sex. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Aftermath [ edit ] The judgement was interpreted as paving the way for the eventual decriminalization of homosexuality in the case of Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018) and adultery in the case of Joseph Shine v. Union of India (2018). Reception [ edit ] The Attorney General of India K. K. Venugopal had opposed the elevation of privacy as a fundamental right while explaining the stand of the Union government of India, in the Supreme Court. [ 7 ] Later on while delivering the speech in the farewell ceremony of CJI JS Khehar, attorney Venugopal noted, \"We have now an extraordinary judgement which has upheld the right to privacy as a major fundamental right which, if we look into the newspapers or TV, has been welcomed by every single person in this country. And that, I think, is one of the greatest things that the Supreme Court of India has done.\" [ 7 ] See also [ edit ] List of landmark court decisions in India Navtej Singh Johar v.

State of Rajasthan: Court Supreme Court of India Full case name Vishaka and Ors. v. State of Rajasthan and Ors. Decided 13 August 1997 Citation AIR 1997 SC 3011 Case history Subsequent action Superseded by The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (\" Sexual Harassment Act\"). Court membership Judges sitting J.S. Verma ( Chief Justice ), Sujata V. Manohar , B.N. Kirpal Case opinions Decision by J.S. Verma (Chief Justice) Vishaka and Ors. v. State of Rajasthan was a 1997 Indian Supreme Court case where various women's groups led by Naina Kapur and her organisation, Sakshi, filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition against the state of Rajasthan and the central Government of India to enforce the fundamental rights of working women under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India . The petition was filed after Bhanwari Devi , a social worker in Rajasthan , was brutally gang raped for stopping a child marriage . [ 1 ] The court decided that the consideration of \"International Conventions and norms are significant for the purpose of interpretation of the guarantee of gender equality, right to work with human dignity in Articles 14, 15, 19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution and the safeguards against sexual harassment implicit therein.\" The petition resulted in what are popularly known as the Vishaka Guidelines. The judgment of August 1997 given by a bench of J. S. Verma (then Chief Justice of India ), Sujata Manohar , and B. N. Kirpal , provided the basic definitions of sexual harassment at the workplace and provided guidelines to deal with it. It is seen as a significant legal victory for women's groups in India. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Background [ edit ] In India, before 1997, there were no formal guidelines for how an incident involving sexual harassment at workplace should be dealt by an employer. Women experiencing sexual harassment at workplace had to lodge a complaint under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code that dealt with the 'criminal assault of women to outrage women's modesty' and Section 509 that punishes an individual or individuals for using a 'word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman'. These sections left the interpretation of 'outraging women's modesty' to the discretion of the police officer. [ 5 ] During the 1990s, Rajasthan state government employee Bhanwari Devi who tried to prevent child marriage as part of her duties as a worker of the Women Development Programme was raped by the landlords of the Gujjar community. The feudal patriarchs who were enraged by her (in their words: \"a lowly woman from a poor and potter community\") 'guts' decided to teach her a lesson and raped her repeatedly. [ 6 ] [ clarification needed ] The  rape survivor did not get justice from Rajasthan High Court and the rapists were allowed to go free. This inspired several women\u2019s groups and non-governmental organizations to file a petition in the Supreme Court under the collective platform of Vishaka [ 7 ] This case brought to the attention of the Supreme Court of India \"the absence of domestic law occupying the field, to formulate effective measures to check the evil of sexual harassment of working women at all work places.\" Judgement [ edit ] In 1997, the Supreme Court laid down guidelines in the Vishakha case, pending formal legislation, for dealing with sexual harassment of women at the workplace. In 1997, the Supreme Court delivered a landmark judgment laying down guidelines to be followed by establishments in dealing with complaints about sexual harassment. \"Vishaka Guidelines\" were stipulated by the Supreme Court of India, in Vishaka and others v State of Rajasthan case in 1997, regarding sexual harassment at workplace. The court stated that these guidelines were to be implemented until legislation is passed to deal with the issue. [ 7 ] The court decided that the consideration of \"International Conventions and norms are significant for the purpose of interpretation of the guarantee of gender equality, right to work with human dignity in Articles 14, 15 19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution and the safeguards against sexual harassment implicit therein.\" The court also defined sexual harassment as including such unwelcome sexually determined behaviour (whether directly or by implication) like physical contact and advances, a demand or request for sexual favours, sexually coloured remarks, showing pornography, or any other unwelcome physical verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature. The court recognised that where any of these acts is committed in circumstances where under the victim of such conduct has a reasonable apprehension that in relation to the victim\u2019s employment or work whether she is drawing salary, or honorarium or voluntary, whether in government, public or private enterprise such conduct can be humiliating and may constitute a health and safety problem. The court noted that it was discriminatory when the woman has reasonable grounds to believe that objecting to sexual harassment would disadvantage her in connection with her employment or work including recruiting or promotion or when it creates a hostile work environment. Thus, sexual harassment need not involve physical contact. Any act that creates a hostile work environment \u2014 be it by virtue of cracking lewd jokes, verbal abuse, circulating lewd rumours etc. \u2014 counts as sexual harassment. [ 8 ] The creation of a hostile work environment through unwelcome physical verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature may consist not of a single act but of pattern of behaviour comprising many such acts. Noting that in some cases, the psychological stigma of reporting the conduct of a co-worker might require a great deal of courage on the part of the victim and they may report such acts after a long period of time. The guidelines suggest that the compliance mechanism should ensure time-bound treatment of complaints, but they do not suggest that a report can only be made within a short period of time since the incident occurred. Often, the police refuse to lodge FIRs for sexual harassment cases, especially where the harassment occurred some time ago. [ 9 ] Subsequent legislation [ edit ] The Supreme Court of India 's judgement only proposed guidelines to alleviate the problem of sexual harassment in 1997. India finally enacted its law on prevention of sexual harassment against female employees at the workplace. The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (\" Sexual Harassment Act\") has been made effective on 23 April 2013 by way of publication in the Gazette of India .
